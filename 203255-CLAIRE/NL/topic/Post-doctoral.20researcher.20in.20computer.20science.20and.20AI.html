<p><strong>About the DILEMA project</strong><br>
The DILEMA project explores interdisciplinary perspectives on military applications of artificial intelligence (AI), with a focus on legal, ethical, and technical approaches on safeguarding human agency over military AI. It analyses in particular subtle ways in which AI can affect or reduce human agency, and seeks to ensure compliance with international law and accountability by design. More information about the project is available on the <a href="https://sable.madmimi.com/c/14945?id=1499012.70527.1.15c1e88d1911e44d1ec3100742ab767a">vacancy page</a> and the <a href="https://sable.madmimi.com/c/14945?id=1499012.70528.1.e59482384bf2a45b9f619bd8a645b734">project’s website</a>.</p>
