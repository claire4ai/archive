<p>Data4lifesciences to Health-RI symposium</p>
<hr>
<p>Date: Monday, March 9, 2020<br>
Time: 13.00 – 17.00<br>
Location: Villa Jongerius, Kanaalweg 64; Utrecht, The Netehrlands</p>
<p>The Data4lifesciences programme has evolved into a highly-appreciated platform for Dutch UMCs to share knowledge on their research data infrastructure. Now, the Dutch UMCs and many partner institutes venture into a new phase with Health-RI, the national data infrastructure for health research.</p>
<p>This symposium is an excellent occasion to look back on the successes of Data4lifesciences and to look forward to the promise of data-driven health research in the Health-RI era.</p>
<p>Who to attend?<br>
The symposium is open to everyone, but will be particularly interesting for anyone involved in FAIR data stewardship, data sharing and IT applications in biomedical research, ranging from people with an IT background to researchers, research support staff, and policy makers.</p>
<p>We particularly welcome those who contributed to the Data4lifesciences program in any way. </p>
