<p>NASA, ESA (European Space Agency) and JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) launched a Virtual Hackathon to Develop COVID-19 Solutions.<br>
Coders, entrepreneurs, scientists, designers, storytellers, makers, builders, artists, and technologists are invited to participate in a virtual hackathon May 30-31 dedicated to putting open data to work in developing solutions to issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic.<br>
During the global Space Apps COVID-19 Challenge, participants from around the world will create virtual teams that – during a 48-hour period – will use Earth observation data to propose solutions to COVID-19-related challenges ranging from studying the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and its spread to the impact the disease is having on the Earth system. <br>
Registration for this challenge opens in mid-May.<br>
