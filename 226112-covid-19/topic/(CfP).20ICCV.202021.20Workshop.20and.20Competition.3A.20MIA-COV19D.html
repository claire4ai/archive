<p><strong>(CfP) ICCV 2021 Workshop and Competition: MIA-COV19D</strong></p>
<p>The Workshop “AI-enabled Medical Image Analysis Workshop and Covid-19 Diagnosis Competition (MIA-COV19D)” will be held in conjunction with the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2021 in Montreal, Canada, October 11- 17, 2021.</p>
<p>Please visit the workshop and competition page at <a href="https://mlearn.lincoln.ac.uk/mia-cov19d/">https://mlearn.lincoln.ac.uk/mia-cov19d/</a>  For any requests or enquiries, please contact: <a href="mailto:stefanos@cs.ntua.gr">stefanos@cs.ntua.gr</a></p>
<p><em>Organizers</em>:<br>
•   Stefanos Kollias, National Technical University of Athens<br>
•   Xujiong Ye, University of Lincoln <br>
•   Luc Bidaut. University of Lincoln <br>
•   Francesco Rundo,  STMicroelectronics ADG—Central R&amp;D<br>
•   Dimitrios Kollias,  University of Greenwich <br>
•   Giuseppe Banna, Portsmouth Hospitals Univ. NHS Trust  </p>
<p>Call for Papers:</p>
<p><strong>A. AI-enabled Medical Image Analysis (MIA) Workshop</strong></p>
<p>AI-enabled Medical Image Analysis (MIA) Workshop will emphasize on radiological quantitative image analysis for diagnosis of diseases. Our focus is placed on Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine and Deep Learning (ML, DL) approaches that target effective and adaptive diagnosis, as well as on  approaches that enforce trustworthiness and create justifications of the decision making process.</p>
<p><em>Important Dates</em>:<br>
July 19, 2021: Paper submission deadline; Start of review period<br>
August 6, 2021:  End of review period<br>
August 10, 2021: Review decisions sent to authors; Notification of acceptance<br>
August 17, 2021: Camera ready version deadline</p>
<p>The peer review process for the papers will be double blind, with at least two distinct reviews per submission, and will follow ICCV standards and policies. The accepted papers will be published in the ICCV proceedings. All submissions must adhere to ICCV style, format and length restrictions.</p>
<p><strong>B. COVID19 Competition</strong></p>
<p>COV19D Competition is based on a new large database of chest CT scan series that is manually annotated for Covid-19/non-Covid-19 diagnosis. The training and validation partitions along with their annotations will be provided to the participating teams to develop AI/ML/DL models for Covid-19/non-Covid-19 prediction. Performance of approaches will be evaluated on the test set.</p>
<p><em>Important Dates</em>:<br>
May 3, 2021: Opening of Competition; start of registration of research groups; provision of training and validation datasets, of respective annotations and of the baseline approach  <br>
July 5, 2021: Final submission deadline (Results, Code and ArXiv paper)                            <br>
July 6, 2021: Winners announcement</p>
<p>There will be one Competition winning team. The top-3 performing teams are expected to contribute a paper describing their approach and results to the MIA Workshop. All other teams will be able to submit a paper describing their solutions and final results to the MIA Workshop.     </p>
