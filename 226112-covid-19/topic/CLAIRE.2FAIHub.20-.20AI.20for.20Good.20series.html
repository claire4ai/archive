<p>Last month CLAIRE successfully started its collaboration with AIhub on the <strong>“AI for Good”</strong> focus series. The current content is focused on SDG 3:  <strong>“good health and well-being”</strong> </p>
<p>The COVID-19 taskforce is contributing to this topic with several articles. Two of them are already published and there are more to come. You can find the published articles here: <a href="https://aihub.org/tag/focus-on-good-health-and-well-being/">https://aihub.org/tag/focus-on-good-health-and-well-being/</a></p>
<p>Since the AIhub finds the SDG topic <strong>“good health and well-being”</strong> very crucial, they decided to prolong it for another month.</p>
<p><strong>Are you interested in getting involved?</strong></p>
<p>We are looking for researchers who work in healthcare and AI who are interested in writing or talking about their work. You could write (or describe on video) a short blog post about your research, write an opinion piece about an area of current interest, give a tutorial, or take part in an interview. If you are interested, please do get in touch at <a href="mailto:aihuborg@gmail.com">aihuborg@gmail.com</a>.</p>
