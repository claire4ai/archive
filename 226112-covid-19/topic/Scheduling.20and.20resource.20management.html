<p>I collaborate with the SME SurgiQ srl (<a href="https://www.surgiq.com/" target="_blank" title="https://www.surgiq.com/">https://www.surgiq.com/</a>), exactly on one of the topics mentioned in the document sent to the EU president, i.e.  â€œScheduling and resource management"</p>
<p>As an example, we have defined, implemented and tested recently, and exploited both in papers and in research projects, approaches for scheduling Operating Rooms under several requirements taking into account beds availability, and previously solutions to personell scheduling problems, all based on ASP. Our tool/framework can be managed and explored also via a web interface. We are working with a customer on such problem, but of course this does not prevent the chance of collaborating on it. </p>
<p>On Friday we also submitted a joint SME Instrument EU project on this topic. </p>
<p>You may find some of these papers at my home page<br>
