<p><strong>VUB AI Webinar series: AI &amp; Data-driven solutions amid the COVID-19 crisis</strong></p>
<p>The VUB AI Experience Centre launches a webinar series by academic AI &amp; Data experts about recent efforts to fight COVID-19. <br>
The series will kick off Monday, May 11, 2020: 11.00-12.00.</p>
<p>In the wake of the Corona crisis, scientific research groups of various fields have committed themselves to help key players in the healthcare, the economy, or policy makers. As the AI Experience Centre comprises four different multidisciplinary research groups, some affiliated researchers have also been heavily involved in creating solutions for the different challenges our society was recently faced with. As such, the Centre found itself in a unique position since it has had a front-row seat to witness the AI-driven challenges our scientists worked on. For this reason, we have created a webinar series where the audience can learn about the key take-aways from the crisis across several sectors.</p>
