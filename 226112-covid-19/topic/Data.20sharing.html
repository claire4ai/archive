<h2>EU Commission, EMBL-EBI and partners release Covid-19 data portal</h2>
<p>Rapid and open sharing of data greatly accelerates research and discovery, which is essential to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. The European Commission and EMBL’s European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), together with EU Member States and research partners such as ELIXIR, are deploying a dedicated European COVID-19 Data Platform that will enable the rapid collection and comprehensive data sharing of available research data from different sources for the European and global research communities. This joint effort is a priority pilot to realise the objectives of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC).</p>
