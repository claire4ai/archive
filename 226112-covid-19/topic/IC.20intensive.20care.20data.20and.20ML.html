<p>Dear network, Pr.JL Vincent, Belgian doctor big expert in Intensive Care, whom I contacted to propose my voluntary help in data science, was very impressed by  this recent Nature article <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0789-4" target="_blank" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0789-4">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0789-4</a>. In my group, we are retrieving data (cohort of 50K patients). Even if they are not COVID data (and  we have (luckily) not yet a similar cohort ) I was thinking that it could be interesting to use them as baseline to analyse major differences with COVID patients.  If you have any suggestion on this matter, contact me. Best</p>
