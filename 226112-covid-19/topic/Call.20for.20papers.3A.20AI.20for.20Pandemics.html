<h1>Call for papers: AI for Pandemics</h1>
<p>While the entire scientific community is rushing to find an effective treatment, researchers working in the field of Artificial Intelligence are devoting significant effort to contribute towards answering some of the key questions related to this pandemic. The current circumstances indicate that there exists an urgent need for data-driven multidisciplinary research in response to public health emergencies and socio-economic crises caused by COVID-19 in particular, and pandemics in general.</p>
<p>This special issue aims to bring together recent advances in AI methods for pandemics. In particular, we welcome interdisciplinary submissions at the interface of machine learning, signal processing, and network science in key pandemic related fields, including biology, medicine, drug discovery, epidemiology, economics, and social sciences.</p>
