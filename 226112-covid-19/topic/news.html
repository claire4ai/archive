<p>Google is using location data gathered from smartphones to create mobility reports and help public health officials understand how people’s movements have changed in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic. <br>
The reports cover 131 countries, to start. In many locations, users can search for more regional data, examining reports for individual states, provinces, and counties. <br>

<p>Covid-19 disrupted our way of living. There are currently more than 3 billion people locked down at home worldwide. Thanks to AI technologies we had been able to contrast the development of Covid-19 and to better manage and evaluate the impact of the measures taken by governments to face the crisis. Today, several countries are entering or evaluating Phase 2: how can we safely start going out again, without risking a come-back of the pandemic. <br>
AI technologies can be used to track the movements of the public and re-build the contacts someone infected has had. Identifying these people, testing them and if necessary, quarantining them will prevent a further diffusion of Covid-19 and help us to move freely again. It is recommended that a single solution will be adopted in Europe. And it is also recommended that the chosen solution will respect the privacy of EU citizens.  There are several solutions under development, a quite interesting one is PEPP-PT, developed by a team of 130 academic in 8 EU countries, which analyzes Bluetooth signals between mobile phones to detect users who are close enough to infect each other. That data will be temporarily stored on the phones and if the users will later test positive for the virus, the app alerts anyone who has been around them in preceding days.<br>

<p>COVID-19 PM2.5<br>
Health experts had suspected the coronavirus pandemic would kill more people in areas where there’s higher air pollution. Now, they have preliminary data to back it up.<br>
A new study released on Saturday but not yet peer reviewed is the first to look at the impact of the novel coronavirus on highly polluted parts of the U.S. The team found that just a small increase in long-term air pollution exposure led to a 15 percent rise in the covid-19 death rate.<br>
