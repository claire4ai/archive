<p>The German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) GmbH,<br>
very cordially invites applications for one open position of </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>       Researcher (m/f/d)
</code></pre></div>

<p>for Quantum Artifical Intelligence (QAI) in the DFKI research department <br>
of Agents and Simulated Reality in Saarbruecken, Germany.</p>
<p>This full-time position is initially for a limited period of three years.<br>
The successful applicant will focus on basic research and development of novel hybrid quantum-classical AI <br>
(Quantum AI) algorithms for selected, computationally hard AI problems with applications in the automotive <br>
industry including optimal production planning and collision-free navigation of self-driving cars. <br>
The extent to which the adaptation of selected classical AI methods for quantum computing using suitable <br>
existing and possibly further or newly developed quantum algorithms (quantum circuits) is theoretically feasible <br>
and beneficial shall be investigated in depth. Apart from simulation on a classical computer, the partial execution <br>
of developed hybrid QAI algorithms on a real quantum computer available for this purpose by our partners is aimed for.</p>
<p>The position requires a very good master degree or a PhD either in computer science with focus on AI,<br>
or in physics with focus on quantum computing. <br>
Good knowledge of the mathematics of quantum computation and quantum algorithms, as well as in the AI fields of <br>
machine learning, in particular deep reinforcement learning, planning and optimisation is required.<br>
Programming experience (e.g. Python, Java, C++, TensorFlow, Xanadu PennyLane, IBM QISKit), good command <br>
of written and spoken English, a high level of committment, strong teamwork skills and ability to <br>
work independently are expected.<br>
The successful applicant will conduct basic research in the future-oriented Quantum AI field with application to <br>
automotive industry. DFKI is one of the worldwide largest AI research centers and located on an awarded location <br>
for computer science in the city of Saarbruecken, Germany</p>
<p>To apply, please send your meaningful application (including cover letter; professional CV; <br>
scanned copies of relevant transcripts of records and certificates) in a single PDF file, <br>
by email to PD Dr. Matthias Klusch at <a href="mailto:matthias.klusch@dfki.de">matthias.klusch@dfki.de</a>.</p>
<p>All incoming applications are considered until the position is filled! <br>
The QAI research project for the position is currently expected to commence April 1, 2021.</p>
<p>Contact: PD Dr. Matthias Klusch, <a href="mailto:matthias.klusch@dfki.de">matthias.klusch@dfki.de</a></p>
<p>DFKI is an equal opportunity employer. Priority will be given to applicants with severe disabilities<br>
if their professional and personal qualifications are essentially the same. DFKI intends to increase<br>
the proportion of women in science and therefore expressly invites women to apply.</p>
