<p><strong>Request for experts to help in Belgium’s benchmarking of AI solutions to analyse legal documents  </strong></p>
<p>Dear All, </p>
<p>The<strong> Federal Public Service Finance of Belgium</strong> is looking for people and contacts to benchmark its project on analysing the use of AI to support officials in formulating efficient arguments for the files to be brought to a court.</p>
<p>The project is aimed at sorting out the arguments from tax law and comparing them with the decisions of a judge in a specific court. The intention is to use the most efficient arguments per matter in order to win as many cases as possible. </p>
<p>It also aims to support officials by simplifying and standardising its processes. There are so many files that tax matters are becoming so complicated that no one is able to have a broad knowledge of all legal matters. Case law is not fully published in Belgium. The judges decide and choose a number (or no) files. It's their decisions, there are no standard criteria.</p>
<p>To address this issue, the FPS would like to invite people involved in projects with the same goal to participate in the study by answering the attached short questionnaire. Interested participants may reach out to <strong>rupana.syedazorali@minfin.fed.be.</strong></p>
