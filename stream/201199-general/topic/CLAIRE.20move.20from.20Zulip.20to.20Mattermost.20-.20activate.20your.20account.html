<p><strong>CLAIRE move from Zulip to Mattermost - activate your account</strong></p>
<p>Dear <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="*">@all</span> ,</p>
<p>As you may know, CLAIRE plays an important leadership role in the ICT-48 Coordination and Support Action, <a href="https://www.vision4ai.eu/vision/">VISION</a>, which aims to bring together and amplify the impact of the four networks of centres of excellence funded under the call ICT-48-2020. To facilitate exchange between these networks, and to stimulate synergy and convergence within the European AI communities, VISION and CLAIRE have jointly set up a Mattermost communication platform that is fully hosted in Europe. </p>
<p>This Mattermost installation is kindly hosted by Inria and jointly administered with CIIRC, with the intention to establish it as the central communication hub for AI research and innovation in Europe. As such, AI communities beyond the ICT-48 projects and CLAIRE are invited to join the platform to facilitate communication and exchange across different parts of the European AI communities and its stakeholders. </p>
<p>To support this effort, CLAIRE is moving from the Zulip communication platform to the new Mattermost setup, where we are administrating a Mattermost Team that is accessible to all CLAIRE members and supporters. The conversations hosted in Zulip will remain accessible as an archive, but new posting will be disabled on Monday, 26 July, 15:00 CEST.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure for joining</strong></p>
<p>If you already have a Mattermost account on <a href="http://talk.vision4ai.eu">talk.vision4ai.eu</a> (e.g. because you are a member of the ICT-48 networks TAILOR or VISION) you'll be added automatically to the CLAIRE team.</p>
<p>If you did not yet have an account, we have created one for you based on your name and email. To “regain” your account  you will need to:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Go to</strong> <a href="https://talk.vision4ai.eu/claire">https://talk.vision4ai.eu/claire</a></li>
<li>Click <strong>“I forgot my password”</strong></li>
<li>Enter your email address (the one to which you received this email), and click <strong>“Reset my password”</strong></li>
<li>You’ll receive an email with instructions to <strong>enter a “new” password</strong></li>
<li><strong>Go to </strong>https://talk.vision4ai.eu/claire</li>
<li>Enter your email and password  </li>
<li>Once this is done, you should be in!</li>
</ol>
<p>In case of problems, let us know, and we’ll do our best to solve it swiftly!</p>
<p>Once in the CLAIRE Mattermost Team you will see that you have been automatically added to the channels "events", "general", "CLAIRE news", "Off-Topic" and "Town Square”. To join other channels, use the “Browse channels” button at the top of your menu.</p>
<p>You will also be added to the VISION4AI Team (this may take up to 24 hours), which will be the meeting place for all AI communitiests.</p>
<p>For more information on how to use Mattermost please see the <a href="https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/user.html">User Guide</a> or post your question in the “Mattermost help” channel in the VISION4AI Team.</p>
<p>Lastly, many thanks to the CLAIRE Supporters that gave their feedback on the CLAIRE Mattermost onboarding process!</p>

<p><a href="http://talk.vision4ai.eu/claire">talk.vision4ai.eu/claire</a> does not send an email for password reset to the address from which I am sending you this email; despite it being a valid email address for which you have been using in the CLAIRE mailing list; and despite it already being established with a password in the original CLAIRE registration. Please keep me on the mailing list without a password - there is no need for yet another one. You have my registration details.</p>
