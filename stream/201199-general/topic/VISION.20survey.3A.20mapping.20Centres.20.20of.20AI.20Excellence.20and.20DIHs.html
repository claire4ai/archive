<p>Dear all, </p>
<p>Our colleagues from the VISION project, Value and Impact through Synergy, Interaction and coOperation of Networks of AI Excellence Centres, have just launched a <strong>survey for mapping collaboration models between Centres of AI Excellence and DIHs! </strong></p>
<p>VISION the a Coordination and Support Action financed by the Horizon 2020 programme aimed to reinforce, interconnect and mobilise Europe’s AI community. In this context, the Consortium contributes and acts as a transversal enabler to make collaboration opportunities among Digital Innovation Hubs (DIHs) and Networks of AI Centres of Excellence (NoEs) come to life.</p>
<p>The key objective of this survey is to explore the current relations and collaboration models among AI Centres of Excellence and DIHs, with the final goal to identify cooperation models among these entities and unlock follow-up activities to make them more effective. </p>
<p>This survey is a big opportunity to help shape the future of AI in Europe by improving collaboration between Industry, Academia and Public Administrations. Please make sure to share this with your consortium partners, your feedback will be collected and used to guide further positive changes for the AI Community in Europe!</p>
