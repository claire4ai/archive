<p><strong>Postdoc positions in Reasoning and Learning at Linköping University, Sweden</strong></p>
<p>The Reasoning and Learning Group at Linköping University in Sweden has two open postdoc positions (up to 2 years each) for doing curiosity driven basic research in the intersection between reasoning and learning. </p>
<p>Application deadline March 8.</p>
<p>We are a growing research group with a broad interest in AI that publish in leading venues with many international connections such as the TAILOR network. We are especially interested in</p>
<ul>
<li>Incremental reasoning and learning especially stream reasoning,</li>
<li>
<p>spatio-temporal reasoning and learning for example about trajectories<br>
and events/activities,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>multi-agent reasoning and learning for example combinatorial<br>
assignment and multi-agent multi-objective reinforcement learning, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reasoning and learning for Trustworthy AI such as privacy-preserving<br>
synthetic data generation and run-time verification for safe autonomous<br>
systems.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At least one of the postdocs will work on developing new machine learning methods for creating privacy preserving synthetic spatio-temporal trajectory data sets. The goal is to 1) extend generative adversarial network (GAN) methods to learn generative spatio-temporal trajectory models and 2) develop new Bayesian Optimization methods for creating tailored privacy-preserving synthetic data sets using these generative models.</p>
<p>We welcome applicants that have their own research ideas that are aligned with the research group.</p>
<p>For more information and to apply see:<br>

<p>The application deadline is March 8. It would be good if you can start after the summer (or earlier). It is possible to start working remotely if needed.</p>
