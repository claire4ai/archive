<p>We offer a 4 year fully funded PhD position at the ADA research group, LIACS, Leiden University, supervised by Holger Hoos and Jan van Rijn. For AI systems to be trustworthy, they need to signal clearly when they “get out of their depth”, i.e., when their output (information, advice, actions) should be treated with caution or becomes entirely unreliable. For example, a configurator can configure a SAT solver to handle a ‘stream’ of SAT instances. However, once the new instances do no longer resemble the instances under which the solver was configured, performance might degrade and ideally the solver should be reconfigured.</p>
<p>In this project, we will develop methods capable of detecting whether the trained system is no longer up to date, signaling users when this is the case. There is an obvious trade-off between the additional cost of running an outdated system on the new instances, versus the cost to reconfigure the system to better perform on the new instances. Moreover, we aim to identify locations in the meta-feature space where EPMs (more general: AutoML systems) work poorly (e.g., due to lack of training instances, ambiguous training instances) and produce instance generators that can fill these gaps.</p>
<p>A more elaborate version of this description can be found on the URL below. There is funding for a PhD student (4 years); the position will depend on the experience of the successful candidate. The project will be embedded in the Automated Design of Algorithms group at the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science. The group is headed by Professor Holger Hoos, and can be found at <a href="http://ada.liacs.nl/" target="_blank" title="http://ada.liacs.nl/">http://ada.liacs.nl/</a>.</p>
