<p>In part celebration of our 2nd founding anniversary, we gladly present a webinar featuring results and way forward of the CLAIRE Task Force on AI and COVID-19 on 15 July 2020, 11:00 AM CET.</p>
<p>Following the launch of CLAIRE Task Force COVID-19 on 20 March 2020, more than 150 AI researchers throughout Europe collected and curated resources which aimed to leverage AI techniques in the context of COVID-19 and to support the development of new projects in several application areas. Under this task force, seven major groups were formed working on mobility and monitoring data analysis; bioinformatics; medical image analysis; social dynamics and networks monitoring; robotics; and scheduling &amp; resource management.</p>
<p>The webinar will focus on discussing three-month task force outcomes in the areas of AI for bioinformatics, drug repurposing, and medical image analysis. It will feature experiences and insights of Emanuela Girardi, Co-coordinator of CLAIRE and the COVID-19 Task Force; Giovanni Stilo, Assistant Professor, Department of Information Engineering, Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of L'Aquila; Andrea Beccari, Business Unit Head, R&amp;D Platforms and Services of Dompé farmaceutici SpA; Marco Aldinucci, Professor, Computer Science Department of the University of Torino; and Silvio Tossato, Deputy Head of Node ELIXIR-Italy.</p>
