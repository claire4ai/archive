<p>Abstract: Measuring algorithmic bias is crucial both to assess algorithmic fairness, and to guide the improvement of algorithms. Current methods to measure algorithmic bias in computer vision, which are based on observational datasets, are inadequate for this task because they conflate algorithmic bias with dataset bias. To address this problem I will propose experimental method for measuring algorithmic bias of face analysis algorithms, which manipulates directly the attributes of interest, e.g., gender and skin tone, in order to reveal causal links between attribute variation and performance change. The method is based on generating synthetic “transects” of matched sample images that are designed to differ along specific attributes while leaving other attributes constant. A crucial aspect of our approach is relying on the perception of human observers, both to guide manipulations, and to measure algorithmic bias. Besides allowing the measurement of algorithmic bias, synthetic transects have other advantages with respect to observational datasets: sampling  attributes more evenly, allowing for more straightforward bias analysis on minority and intersectional groups, enabling prediction of bias in new scenarios, reducing ethical and legal challenges, and they are economical and fast to obtain, helping make bias testing affordable and widely available. The method is validated by comparing it to a study that employs the traditional observational method for analyzing bias in gender classification algorithms. The two methods reach different conclusions. While the observational method reports gender and skin color biases, the experimental method reveals biases due to gender, hair length, age, and facial hair.</p>

<p>Abstract: Computers are still largely not connotated with emotional intelligence – even more than two decades after the kick-off of the Affective Computing as the core discipline in this regard. Yet, recently significant advancement took place in the recognition of human emotion and generation of simulated emotional behaviour by computing devices increasingly lending them “Artificial Emotional Intelligence”. This can open up a rich selection of exciting applications to become reality such as completely changing how we interact with computing devices. In this talk, we will dive deep into the latest developments in multimodal Affective Computing from the AI perspective. This includes self-learning of neural architectures by AutoML, reinforcement learning, lifelong and self-supervised learning, “green” efficient learning, federated learning, but also using emotion in learning itself. Furthermore, we will look into robustness issues such as against adversarial attacks or package loss. Beyond showing these and further recent trends and developments largely basing on deep learning techniques, the talk will end on the major needed final steps at “T-minus 3” to make Artificial Emotional Intelligence take-off and “fly” in real-world applications at scale.</p>

<p>Abstract: I will present several recent results of my group on learning robust driving policies that have advanced the state-of-the-art in the CARLA self-driving simulation environment. To generalize across diverse conditions, humans leverage multiple types of situation-specific reasoning and learning strategies. Motivated by this observation, I will first present a framework for learning situational driving policies that effectively captures reasoning under varying types of scenarios and leads to 98% success rate on the CARLA self-driving benchmark as well as state-of-the-art performance on a novel generalization benchmark. Next, I will discuss the problem of covariate shift in imitation learning. I will demonstrate that existing data aggregation techniques for addressing this problem have poor generalization performance, and present a novel approach with empirically better generalization performance. Finally, I will talk about the importance of intermediate representations and attention for learning robust self-driving models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human face-to-face communication is a little like a dance, in that participants continuously adjust their behaviors based on verbal and nonverbal cues from the social context. Today’s computers and interactive devices are still lacking many of these human-like abilities to hold fluid and natural interactions. Leveraging recent advances in machine learning, audio-visual signal processing and computational linguistic, my research focuses on creating computational technologies able to analyze, recognize and predict human subtle communicative behaviors in social context. Central to this research effort is the introduction of new probabilistic models able to learn the temporal and fine-grained latent dependencies across behaviors, modalities and interlocutors. In this talk, I will present some of our recent achievements in multimodal machine learning, addressing five core challenges: representation, alignment, fusion, translation and co-learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: <br>
Video generation consists of generating a video sequence so that an object in a source image is animated according to some external information (a conditioning label or the motion of a driving video). In this talk I will present some of our recent achievements adressing these specific aspects: 1) generating facial expressions, e.g., smiles that are different from each other (e.g., spontaneous, tense, etc.) using diversity as the driving force. 2) generating videos without using any annotation or prior information about the specific object to animate.</p>
<p>Once trained on a set of videos depicting objects of the same category (e.g. faces, human bodies), our method can be applied to any object of this class. To achieve this, we decouple appearance and motion information using a self-supervised formulation. To support complex motions, we use a representation consisting of a set of learned keypoints along with their local affine transformations. A generator network models occlusions arising during target motions and combines the appearance extracted from the source image and the motion derived from the driving video. Our solutions score best on diverse benchmarks and on a variety of object categories.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>
Image understanding benefits from the modeling of knowledge about both the scene observed and the objects it contains as well as their relationships. We show in this context the contribution of hybrid artificial intelligence, combining different types of formalisms and methods, and combining knowledge with data. Knowledge representation may rely on symbolic and qualitative approaches, as well as semi-qualitative ones to account for their imprecision or vagueness. Structural information can be modeled in several formalisms, such as graphs, ontologies, logical knowledge bases, or neural networks, on which reasoning will be based. The problem of image understanding is then expressed as a problem of spatial reasoning. These approaches will be illustrated with examples in medical imaging, illustrating the usefulness of combining several approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br>
Due to the proliferation of whole-slide-imaging (WSI) digital scanners it is now possible to leverage computer vision, image analysis, and machine learning techniques, such as deep learning to process the digital pathology images in hopes to derive, diagnosis and prognosis markers. The convergence of digital imaging, data science and pathology gave rise to a new research area known as digital pathology. Digital pathology greatly enhances diagnostic accuracy and allows a variety of pathology tasks to be completed with greater efficiency. This presentation will offer a general introduction to the topic, it will outline and discuss imaging tasks needed for the successful implementation of a digital pathology pipeline, and it will offer overview and insights on how data-driven solutions such as deep neural networks can be used to derive markers from digital pathology slides. It will also be shown that a diagnostic system that combines deep learning and prior histological knowledge can provide useful diagnostic/prognostic markers. Lastly, open research issues and implementation challenges will be briefly discussed.</p>
