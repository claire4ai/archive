<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>On behalf of Linas Petkevičius, Board member of the Artificial Intelligence Association of Lithuania, we would like to invite you to join the Vilnius Machine Learning Workshop.</p>
<p>Vilnius Machine Learning Workshop (VMLW, 29-30 July 2021) is a two-day workshop aimed to popularise topics related to Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning and Causal Inference among students and practitioners. It is organized by Artificial intelligence association of Lithuania as a satellite event to EEML summer school. The overall goal of these events is to support the regional Machine Learning community. </p>
<p>We invite not only doctoral students, researchers, summer workshops, but also all AIs who are sympathetic and want to get to know:</p>
<p>#generativemodels, #causalinference, #reinforcementlearning.<br>
The two-day event will be remote &amp; free, will include hands-on sessions and interesting presentations from new research from DeepMind, GoogleBrain, Mila - Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute, University of Oxford.</p>
