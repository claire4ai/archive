<p>We are glad to spread the workshop organized by AI4EU and StairwAI "<strong>How we can bring Value to your SME</strong>?" that will be held online, on <strong>25th of June, 12.00 CET</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>SMEs</strong> are an important backbone of the European economy and AI is a promising technology that brings value to people, society, environment and business.</p>
<p>To combine both, Europe is funding dedicated projects that help to bring AI to SMEs by running concrete initiatives that support European SMEs in developing and adopting AI innovation.</p>
<p>In this context, the two projects <a href="https://www.ai4europe.eu/">AI4EU </a> and <a href="https://stairwai.nws.cs.unibo.it/">StairwAI</a> are organizing with selected SMEs a series of consultancy sessions to jointly learn how to better support SMEs in using AI technology to improve their business.</p>
<p><strong>You are invited to join the kick-off workshop of 60 min</strong> that will give you a brief overview of AI and AI use cases and how to get access to needed AI expertise. It will be complemented with a short introduction of the <strong><a href="https://ddi-canvas.com/">DDI Framework</a></strong> that is used by companies and innovators to develop new AI-driven business cases.</p>
<p>In addition, you will be inform how to apply for a free AI Business Consultancy session for your company in which a team of AI experts will investigate together with your team how to use AI to improve your business and you will be first informed when the StairwAI <strong>€2M</strong> grant will be released through open calls later this year</p>
<p>Through the consultancy session your company will develop concrete new business ideas and get guided access to a wide range of AI assets offered by European research labs and universities. And the two mentioned projects will learn how to scale up their support to a wide range of European companies. So a clear win-win situation.</p>
<p>We are looking forward to welcome you at the 25th of June at 12:00 CET.</p>
