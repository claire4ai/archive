<p>Dear CLAIRE friends,</p>
<p>I am writing to let you know about a high-level workshop we have organized titled "The promises and Dark Sides of Artificial Intelligence in NMR, MRI and Neuroscience", which is now online at <a href="https://gidrm2020.uniroma2.it/">https://gidrm2020.uniroma2.it/</a> (complete info are available on the website and in the attached flyer).</p>
<p>We are particularly glad to have recruited <strong>eminent speakers both from the scientific field and from Industry (e.g. Philips, Siemens, Amazon Web Services etc.) </strong> and to have been able to include talks on e.g.<strong> regulatory and ethical aspects as well as sections on explainability, clinical applications and precision medicine</strong>. The format is both asynchronous (until March 31st) and synchronous (live session on Feb 19th, 2021).</p>
<p><strong>The registration deadline is Feb 14th</strong> (extendable). The workshop also carries 30 ECM credits.</p>
<p>In the hope that this initiative may be of interest for you and I would be most grateful if you could relay this scientific and educational resource among your local community as well as professional networks.</p>
<p>Please, do not hesitate to contact me for more information.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Nicola Toschi</p>

<p><strong>SHORT DESCRIPTION</strong>: The primary goal of this workshop is to bring together the diverse but overlapping communities of physicists, chemists, computer scientists, biologists, engineers, economists, clinicians and neuroscientists to explore novel, out-of-the box angles through which trans-disciplinary challenges in NMR, MRI and neuroscience research and technology can be tackled using Artificial Intelligence in a precision medicine context. This will include proposing a vision of the most promising directions and short/mid-term future scientific, technological, ethical and regulatory synergies. The mixed synchronous + aynchronous modality aims to maximize both attendance flexibility and interaction with the speakers as well as between attendees. <a href="/user_uploads/13862/TeXuZoAfo-7YClL6xsmZyyz0/AI_MRI_Neuroscience_workshop_synch_asynch.pdf">AI_MRI_Neuroscience_workshop_synch_asynch.pdf</a><br>
