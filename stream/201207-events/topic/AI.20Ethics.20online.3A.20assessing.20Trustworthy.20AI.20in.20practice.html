<p><strong>AI Ethics online: What did we learn in assessing Trustworthy AI in practice?</strong><br>
AI Ethics Online with Roberto Zicari, from Goethe University Frankfurt.​</p>
<p>Started January 2019, a team of International researchers started to develop a process to assess Trustworthy AI in practice, called Z-inspection. So far, the process has been used to as​sess AI systems in healthcare. In this talk Roberto will report the main lessons learned in assessing several use cases for trustworthy AI in healthcare, namely:<br>
– AI for predicting Cardiovascular Risks<br>
– Machine learning and supportive tool to recognize cardiac arrest in emergency calls <br>
– Deep learning based Skin Lesion Classifiers</p>
<p>​​​​Starting march 2021 will work on this new use case: Deep Learning for predicting a multi-regional score conveying the degree of lung compromise in COVID–19 patients.</p>
