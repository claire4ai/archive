<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>We invite submissions to the 25th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS), and welcome paper submissions on artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, and related areas. <a href="https://aistats.org/aistats2022/cfp.html">https://aistats.org/aistats2022/cfp.html</a></p>
<p>Key dates</p>
<ul>
<li>Abstract submission deadline: Friday, 8 October 2021 11:59am (UTC)</li>
<li>Paper submission deadline: Friday, 15 October 2021 11:59am (UTC)</li>
<li>Supplementary material submission: Friday, 22 October 2021 11:59am (UTC)</li>
<li>Reviews released: Friday, November 26, 2021</li>
<li>Author rebuttals due: Friday, 3 December 2021 11:59am (UTC)</li>
<li>Final decisions: Tuesday, January 18, 2022</li>
<li>Camera-ready deadline: Wednesday, 23 February 2022 11:59am (UTC)</li>
<li>Tentative conference dates: March 30 - April 1, 2022</li>
</ul>
<p>The deadlines are firm. We realize the pandemic is making lives difficult, so we ask the authors to factor in any uncertainties when preparing their papers.</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>AISTATS is an interdisciplinary gathering of researchers at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, and related areas. Since its inception in 1985, the primary goal of AISTATS has been to broaden research in these fields by promoting the exchange of ideas among them. We encourage the submission of all papers which are in keeping with this objective at AISTATS.<br>
Paper Submission (Proceedings Track)</p>
<p>The proceedings track is the standard AISTATS paper submission track. Papers will be selected via a rigorous double-blind peer-review process. All accepted papers will be presented at the Conference as contributed talks or as posters and will be published in the Proceedings.</p>
<p>Solicited topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Machine learning methods and algorithms (classification, regression, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, clustering, logic programming, …)</li>
<li>Probabilistic methods (Bayesian methods, approximate inference, density estimation, tractable probabilistic models, probabilistic programming, …)</li>
<li>Theory of machine learning and statistics (optimization, computational learning theory, decision theory and bandits, game theory, frequentist statistics, information theory, …)</li>
<li>Deep learning (theory, architectures, reinforcement learning, generative models, optimization for neural networks, …)</li>
<li>Ethical and trustworthy machine learning (causality, fairness, interpretability, privacy, robustness, safety, …)</li>
<li>Applications of machine learning and statistics (including natural language, signal processing, computer vision, social sciences, sustainability and climate, healthcare, economics, …)</li>
</ul>
<p>Physical Attendance</p>
<p>The AISTATS 2022 organizing committee is committed to the safety and health of our community. We are currently reviewing the best option for AISTATS 2022 (either physical or virtual conference). In any case, physical attendance will not be mandatory for authors of accepted papers. As soon as we have made a final decision, we will update the information on the webpage. Thank you for your patience and understanding.<br>
Formatting and Supplementary Material</p>
<p>Submissions are limited to 8 pages excluding references using the LaTeX style file we provide below (the page limit will be 9 for camera-ready submissions). The number of pages containing citations alone is not limited. You can also submit a single file of additional supplementary material which may be either a pdf file (such as proof details) or a zip file for other formats/more files (such as code or videos). Note that reviewers are under no obligation to examine the supplementary material. If you have only one supplementary pdf file, please upload it as is; otherwise, gather everything to a single zip file.</p>
<p>Submissions will be through CMT (<a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/AISTATS2022/">https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/AISTATS2022/</a>) and will be open approximately 4-6 weeks before the abstract submission deadline.</p>
<p>Formatting information (including LaTeX style files) is available at <a href="http://aistats.org/aistats2022/AISTATS2022PaperPack.zip">http://aistats.org/aistats2022/AISTATS2022PaperPack.zip</a>. We do not support submission in preparation systems other than LaTeX. Please do not modify the layout given by the style file. If you have questions about the style file or its usage, please contact the publications chair.</p>
<p>Reviewer Nomination</p>
<p>For each submission, the authors will be requested to nominate at least one of the authors as a reviewer for AISTATS 2022. Nominated reviewers are expected to have sufficient expertise in the relevant field. Kindly understand that with a recent increase in submissions, we need more reviewers than in previous years.</p>
<p>Anonymization Requirements</p>
<p>The AISTATS review process is double-blind. All submissions must be anonymized and may not contain any information that can violate the double-blind reviewing policy, such as the author's names or their affiliations, acknowledgments, or links that can infer any author’s identity or institution. Self-citations are allowed as long as anonymity is preserved. It is up to the author’s discretion how best to preserve anonymity when including self-citations. Possibilities include: leaving out a self-citation, including it but replacing the citation text with “removed for anonymous submission,” or leaving the citation as-is. We recommend leaving in a moderate number of self-citations for published or otherwise well-known work.</p>
<p>We strongly discourage advertising the preprint on social media or in the press while under submission to AISTATS. Preprints must not be explicitly identified as an AISTATS submission at any time during the review period (i.e., from the abstract submission deadline until the communication of the accept/reject decision).</p>
<p>Dual Submissions</p>
<p>Submitted manuscripts should not have been previously published in a journal or in the proceedings of a conference, and should not be under consideration for publication at another conference at any point during the AISTATS review process. Submissions as extended abstracts (4 pages or less), to workshops or non-archival venues (without a proceeding), or to arXiv, will not be considered a concurrent submission. It is acceptable to have a substantially extended version of the submitted paper under consideration simultaneously for journal publication, so long as the journal version’s planned publication date is in May 2022 or later, the journal submission does not interfere with AISTATS right to publish the paper, and the situation is clearly described at the time of AISTATS submission. Please describe the situation in the appropriate box on the submission page (and do not include author information in the submission itself, to avoid accidental unblinding). Authors are also allowed to give talks to restricted audiences on the work(s) submitted to AISTATS during the review.</p>
<p>Reviewers will be instructed that tech reports (including reports on sites such as arXiv) and papers in workshops without archival proceedings do not count as prior publication.</p>
<p>All accepted papers will be presented at the Conference either as contributed talks or as posters, and will be published in the AISTATS Conference Proceedings in the Journal of Machine Learning Research Workshop and Conference Proceedings series. Papers for talks and posters will be treated equally in publication.</p>
<p>Confidentiality</p>
<p>The reviewers and area-chairs of your paper will have access to your paper and supplementary material. In addition, the program chairs and workflow chairs will have access to all the papers. Everyone having access to papers and supplementary materials will be instructed to keep them confidential during the review process and delete them after the final decisions.</p>
<p>Reviews will be visible to area chairs, program chairs, and workflow chairs throughout the process. Reviewers will get access to other reviews for a paper after they have submitted their own review.</p>
<p>Author names will be visible to area chairs and program chairs. Reviewers will not know the author's names at any stage of the process. Reviewer names are visible to the area chair (and program chairs), but the reviewers will not know the names of other reviewers.</p>
