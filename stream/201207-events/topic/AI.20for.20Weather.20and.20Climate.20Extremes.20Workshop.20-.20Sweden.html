<p><strong>INVITATION</strong><br>
AI, weather and climate researchers are invited to a two day workshop on applying AI to weather and climate extremes, that have large impact on all aspects of society. There is overwhelming evidence that weather and climate extremes are changing and there is a need to improve the assessments of observed extremes using new techniques. Hosted by the European Space Agency (ESA), AI Innovation of Sweden and working with CLAIRE, the workshop takes place on the  <strong>16-17th of January 2020 at Lindholmen Science Park, in Gothenburg, Sweden</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT THE WORKSHOP</strong><br>
Weather and climate extremes such as heavy precipitation events, heat waves, cold spells, tropical and extratropical storms, coastal sea level surges and ocean waves, are part of the climate system and affect every aspect of society. Observations are needed to assess changes in extremes and to determine contributors to these changes. AI can help address these challenges. Conversely, earth observation-based earth sciences provide huge, high-quality datasets and methodological challenges for AI scientists. The workshop will bring together AI researchers, Earth science and Earth observation experts to identify opportunities to apply AI to weather and climate Extremes, and build collaborations and projects to deliver these opportunities.</p>
<p>The expected outcomes are:<br>
1 - A short paper identifying opportunities to apply AI to extreme weather and climate challenges;<br>
2 - A set of collaborative activities that could deliver these; and finally<br>
3 - A prioritised workplan of projects that ESA should be funding</p>
<p>This is the third in a series of workshops on applying AI to different areas of Earth and climate science. The first one on AI for Climate Change services development was held the 22nd July, the second one Atmospheric water cycling was held the 10 September 2019, at ESA Esrin, Frascati. Future planned workshops include Cryosphere, Data assimilation &amp; modelling, and Oceanography.</p>
