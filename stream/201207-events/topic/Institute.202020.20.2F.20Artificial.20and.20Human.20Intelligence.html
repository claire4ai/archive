<h2>ABOUT THE INSTITUTE</h2>
<p>The Nordic Chapter of the Insitute on Artificial and Human Intelligence is held during November 1-7 2020 in Gothenburg, Sweden. The institute consists of an integrated school, panel, and doctoral colloquium  (primarily but not exclusively) aimed at early career doctoral researchers. Participants include professional academics / researchers, doctoral candidates and industry professionals, and research-driven students. The institute hosts an invited faculty delivering lectures, intensive tutorials, and keynotes; opportunities also exist for young researchers to position ongoing / early stage research, discuss, and network with institute faculty and participants.</p>
<p>/  INSTITUTE FACULTY   /  </p>
<p>—  Mehul Bhatt  (Örebro University, Sweden)   <br>

—  David Whitney  (UC Berkeley, United States)   </p>
<p>—  [ Ongoing  /  Additional faculty members to be announced ]</p>
<p>/  LEARNING FORMAT   /  </p>
<p>The faculty will be involved in presenting mutually synergistic Keynotes, Lectures, and Tutorials. Furthermore, a Panel Discussion is also planned to discuss the theme of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Human-Centred Confluence: Bottom-up Interdisciplinarity for the development of next generation human-centred AI technologies”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Course topics include:</p>
<p>—  Artificial Intelligence and Spatial Cognition<br>
—  Speech and Language. Visual Biofeedback.    <br>
—  Psychophysics. Biological Motion.   <br>
—  Visual Attention. Eye-Movements.<br>
—  Visual Perception. Human Development.<br>
—  Multimodal Linguistics.  Brain and Behaviour.<br>
—  Artificial Intelligence. Knowledge Representation and Learning. <br>
—  Declarative AI and Explainability / Combining Reasoning and Learning.<br>
—  Motion. Spatial Cognition. Cognition.<br>
—  Perception. Action. Vision. <br>
—  Design Cognition and Computation.</p>
<h2>CONFLUENCE  —  COGNITION.  AI.  INTERACTION.  DESIGN.</h2>
<p>Research in Artificial and Human Intelligence aims to bring together and advance a novel &amp; unique combination of research methodologies, academics and communities encompassing artificial intelligence, cognitive science, neuroscience, psychology &amp; human development, human-computer interaction, and design science. In addition to pursuing its core scientific agenda, this line of inquiry also creates a discussion point for the development of interdisciplinary research, projects, collaborations, and other international people-exchange initiatives addressing the Confluence of Cognition, AI, Interaction, and Design.  </p>
<p>/  HUMAN-CENTRED AI &amp; COGNITIVE TECHNOLOGIES  /</p>
<p>The Institute addresses the formal &amp; cognitive foundations for human-centred computing (for AI), and the human-centred design, development, and usability of cognitive technologies aimed at human-in-the-loop assistance &amp; empowerment in decision-making, planning, creative-technical problem-solving, and automation. We emphasise development of novel foundational methods for human-centred AI keeping in mind: interpretability, generality or domain-independence, elaboration tolerance, benchmarking, and re-usability.</p>
<p>/  MINDS.  EXPERIENCES.  TECHNOLOGIES  /  </p>
<p>Of special interest is the design and development of artificial cognitive technologies where the human-centred modelling, interpretation, simulation, and synthesis of embodied cognitive experiences -e.g., encompassing multimodal perception and interaction- is critical.</p>
