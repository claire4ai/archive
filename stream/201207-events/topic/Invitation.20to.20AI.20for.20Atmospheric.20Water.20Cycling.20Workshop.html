<p><strong>INVITATION</strong><br>
AI researchers are invited to a one day workshop on applying AI to Atmospheric water cycling, one of the biggest areas of uncertainty in the understanding of climate change.  Hosted by the European Space Agency (ESA) and working with CLAIRE, the workshop takes place on the <strong>10th of September 2019 at ESA/ESRIN, in Frascati, Italy</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>ABOUT THE WORKSHOP</strong><br>
Water cycling, clouds and water vapour play a crucial role in the climate system, but there are huge scientific challenges to our understanding. AI can help address these challenges. Conversely, earth observation-based earth sciences provide huge, high-quality datasets and methodological challenges for AI scientists. The workshop will bring together AI researchers, Earth science and Earth observation experts to identify opportunities to apply AI to Atmospheric water cycling challenges, and build collaborations and projects to deliver these opportunities. </p>
<p>The expected outcomes are:<br>
1 - A short paper identifying opportunities to apply AI to water cycling challenges;<br>
2 - A set of collaborative activities that could deliver these; and finally<br>
3 - A prioritised workplan of projects that ESA should be funding</p>
<p>This is the first in a series of workshops on applying AI to different areas of Earth and climate science. Future planned workshops include Cryosphere, Extreme weather, Data assimilation &amp; modelling, and Oceanography. <br>
