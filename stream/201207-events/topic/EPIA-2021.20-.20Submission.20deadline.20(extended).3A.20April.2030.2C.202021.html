<p>EPIA 2021<br>
20th EPIA Conference on Artificial Intelligence<br>
<a href="http://www.appia.pt/epia2021/">http://www.appia.pt/epia2021/</a><br>

<hr>
<p>The EPIA Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a well-established European conference in the field of AI.<br>
The 20th edition of the EPIA conference will take place online in 2021. As in previous editions, this international<br>
conference is hosted with the patronage of the Portuguese Association for Artificial Intelligence (APPIA). The<br>
purpose of this conference is to promote research in all areas of AI, covering both theoretical/foundational issues<br>
and applications, and the scientific exchange among researchers, engineers and practitioners in related<br>
disciplines.</p>
<hr>
<p>Thematic Tracks</p>
<hr>
<p>EPIA 2021 will feature the following thematic tracks covering a wide spectrum of AI topics:<br>
AIoTA - Artificial Intelligence and IoT in Agriculture<br>
AIL - Artificial Intelligence and Law<br>
AIM - Artificial Intelligence in Medicine<br>
AIPES - Artificial Intelligence in Power and Energy Systems<br>
AITS - Artificial Intelligence in Transportation Systems<br>
ALEA - Artificial Life and Evolutionary Algorithms<br>
AmIA - Ambient Intelligence and Affective Environments<br>
GAI- General AI<br>
GeoAI - GeoSpatial Artificial Intelligence<br>
IROBOT - Intelligent Robotics<br>
KDBI - Knowledge Discovery and Business Intelligence<br>
KRR - Knowledge Representation and Reasoning<br>
MASTA - Multi-Agent Systems: Theory and Applications<br>
TeMA - Text Mining and Applications</p>
<hr>
<p>Submission and Reviewing</p>
<hr>
<p>All papers should be submitted in PDF format through the EPIA 2021 EasyChair submission page. Prospective<br>
authors should select the thematic track to which their paper is to be submitted. The papers should be prepared<br>
according to the Springer LNCS format, with a maximum of 12 pages. Some thematic tracks (see each track<br>
specific page) may accept short papers (max 6 pages). Submitted papers will be subject to a doubleblind<br>
review process and will be peer-reviewed by at least three members of the respective track Program<br>
Committee. It is the responsibility of the authors to remove names and affiliations from the submitted papers, and<br>
to take reasonable care to assure anonymity during the review process.<br>
Authors should consult Springer’s authors’ guidelines and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or<br>
for Word, for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their<br>
papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper,<br>
must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should<br>
match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes<br>
relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made.</p>
<hr>
<p>Proceedings and Presentations</p>
<hr>
<p>Accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings (a volume of Springer’s LNAI-Lecture Notes in<br>
Artificial Intelligence), provided that at least one author is registered in EPIA 2021 by the early registration<br>
deadline. EPIA 2021 proceedings are indexed in Thomson Reuters ISI Web of Science, Scopus, DBLP and<br>
Google Scholar.<br>
Each accepted paper must be presented by one of the authors in a track session.</p>
<hr>
<p>Awards</p>
<hr>
<p>The conference will grant the following award:</p>
<ul>
<li>Best Paper Award, for the best research paper presented at the conference sponsored by Springer<br>
Only papers that have been submitted to a thematic track and presented at the conference will be eligible for this<br>
award.</li>
