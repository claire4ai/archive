<p>Date: Thursday, May 14th, Noon Eastern</p>
<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence for the Impact Economy</strong></p>
<p>Like the Impact Economy, machine learning transforms established ways of doing business. Recent breakthroughs have made this powerful technology accessible to a whole new range of businesses. Impact entrepreneurs are now using this organizational intelligence to pioneer some truly inspiring applications of artificial intelligence — including helping to combat the coronavirus.</p>
<p>This live webinar and Q&amp;A features senior leaders from four growing businesses deeply involved in applying artificial intelligence for social and ecological impact. We will discuss, among other topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>How machine learning is being used to help tackle the covid-19 pandemic</li>
<li>The kinds of problems for which machine learning is well-suited</li>
<li>Options for impact entrepreneurs in acquiring machine learning expertise</li>
<li>Challenges and opportunities in funding Impact AI</li>
<li>Building funder/customer capacity for understanding and applying machine learning</li>
<li>Opportunities for partnering with philanthropy and NGOs to develop Impact AI</li>
<li>Using mission to compete with well-funded “big tech” to recruit and retain tech talent</li>
</ul>
