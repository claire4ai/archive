<p>4th Int. Summer School on Deep Learning (5-9.07.2021)</p>
<p>Dear colleagues,</p>
<p>We would like to invite you and your students to join our 4th International (Virtual) Summer School on Deep Learning (5-9 July 2021, <a href="http://2021.dl-lab.eu">2021.dl-lab.eu</a>). </p>
<p>Outstanding speakers (e.g. Alftredo Canziani, Sebastian Raschka, etc.) and experienced instructors from all over the world will present scientific background, practical issues and perspectives for the future of deep learning methods. <br>
It is a non-commercial event. The registration fee is affordable and is limited to cover only basic organizational costs (39Euro or 49Euro). We have many applications every year. For more information about registration and application process please visit our website: <a href="https://2021.dl-lab.eu">https://2021.dl-lab.eu</a>.<br>
During the virtual edition of our School we are working together using Zoom, Slack and other platforms. We are organizing many virtual, social events and challenges believing that the interaction between participants is very important part of the school.</p>
<p>In parallel, between 8th and 10th July we are organizing 14th International Conference (IEEE/IES) on Human-System Interaction (papers have been indexed by Web Of Science, Scopus, etc. for about 10 years). Many conference topics and special sessions are focused on machine learning and artificial intelligence. All the accepted authors of the HSI conference will be automatically accepted for the Summer School (if they additionally register for the School). More information about the conference: <a href="http://hsi2021.welcometohsi.org">http://hsi2021.welcometohsi.org</a></p>
