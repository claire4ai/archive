<p>The Forum will be opened by the keynote by Hon. Věra Jourová, European Vice-President for Values and Transparency.<br>
She will unveil the European Democracy Action Plan, the European Commission flagship initiative that seeks to strengthen democracy and promote digital literacy. <br>
Her intervention will set the scene for the two-day discussions engaging among the others sociologist and Spanish Minister of Universities Manuel Castells, former EU President Romano Prodi, and public policy analyst Jeffrey Sachs. </p>
<p>Peer-reviewed academic papers will address and discuss pressing questions about the impact of AI, blockchain, and ADM on political decisions, social involvement, the functioning of parties, information access, and integrity.</p>
