<p>I am delighted to let you know that we have received official notifications that the results of the ICT-48 selection process look amazingly good for CLAIRE:</p>

<p>Our CSA proposal, VISION, has been selected for funding, along with the TAILOR and HumanE-AI-Net proposals in which CLAIRE had major involvement.</p>

<p>Overall, four of the five ICT-48 proposals selected for funding are coordinated by members of CLAIRE.</p>

<p>At the same time, the ICT-48 process has produced an outcome that does not directly benefit important parts of the European AI research ecosystem. It is unfortunate that the call and process have been structured in a way that produces winners and loser. VISION, TAILOR and HumanE-AI have all been constructed in a way that brings benefits also to institutions and groups outside of the respective consortia.</p>

<p>CLAIRE is deeply committed to working with the European Commission to ensure that those critical parts of the European AI research landscape that are not directly covered by winning ICT-48 proposals will be supported in future rounds of funding. We need to ensure that <em>all</em> AI research excellence in Europe is leveraged towards the success of "AI made in Europe", as per the CLAIRE vision.</p>

<p>Dear Colleagues, <br>
Just to add that the AI4Media project (led by CERTH)  that was accepted for funding also involves CLAIRE, at least via our participation as partner, i.e., University Politehnica of Bucharest, Research Center CAMPUS. Therefore, if I am not wrong, CLAIRE is now involved in all the accepted ICT-48 proposals, which is great. AI4Media also brings benefits to a large network of institutions and groups outside the consortia (&gt;38).</p>

<p>Actually, AI4Media is led by a CLAIRE network member ... <span aria-label="slight smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="slight smile">:slight_smile:</span></p>
