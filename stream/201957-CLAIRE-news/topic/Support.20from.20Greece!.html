<p>Hot off the press: Greece, one of the cradles of European culture and values, has just become the 8th country whose government has officially confirmed support of the #CLAIRE vision: <a href="https://claire-ai.org/support-greece" target="_blank" title="https://claire-ai.org/support-greece">https://claire-ai.org/support-greece</a>. ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡ºðŸŽ‰<br>
That's 3 countries over the last 50 days ... at that rate, we'll have the entire EU covered within the next 12 months ðŸ™‚<br>
Let's see who's next ... we know of at least three other, major efforts towards producing letters of support that are currently underway. If you are in a position to encourage your government to write a letter of support for CLAIRE, and you need any support from the CLAIRE core team, please let us know - we'll be happy to help.</p>
