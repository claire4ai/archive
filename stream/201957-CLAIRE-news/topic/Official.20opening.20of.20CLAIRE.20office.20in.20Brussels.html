<p>In light of the recent health &amp; safety concerns related to the COVID-19 outbreak in Europe, we have decided to postpone the opening event for the CLAIRE office in Brussel, which was originally planned for next week Tuesday, 17 March 2020. </p>
<p>Restrictions on travel and meetings are being issued all over Europe and would make it difficult or impossible for us to run our event next week as planned. We have therefore decided to postpone the event and will decide on a new date as soon as the situation allows us to run it in such a way that it will create a broad and impactful discussion on the future of AI research and innovation in Europe and CLAIRE's role in achieving that.</p>
<p>Also in light of the present situation in Europe, we have decided to mobilise the CLAIRE network to provide assistance with efforts in containing and managing the COVID-19 outbreak that may benefit from AI and IT expertise, on a volunteer basis.</p>
