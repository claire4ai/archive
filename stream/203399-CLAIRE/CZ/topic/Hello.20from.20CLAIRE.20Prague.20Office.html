<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I would like to start activities on this channel with an introduction of the <strong>CLAIRE Prague Office</strong>. </p>
<p>The office was officially opened on the 26 September 2019, during the RICAIP Kick off ceremony (<a href="http://ricaip.eu/2019/09/27/ricaip-kickoff-ceremony/" target="_blank" title="http://ricaip.eu/2019/09/27/ricaip-kickoff-ceremony/">ricaip.eu/2019/09/27/ricaip-kickoff-ceremony/</a>), but has been in operation since early 2019.<br>
The office is located at the Czech Technical University in Prague in CIIRC building. Currently there are 3 personnel working at this office - the head of the office, <strong>Vít Dočkal</strong> and two other members - <strong>Markéta Iffland</strong> and myself.</p>
<p>We would like to make this stream a place for sharing local information concerning AI, ideas and other relevant information.</p>
<p>Please feel free to do so and in case of any needed information and/or support, please, do not hesitate to contact anyone from the CLAIRE Prague office.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Anna Tahovská</p>
