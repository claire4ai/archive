<p>Forwarded on behave of Martin Golumbic &lt;<a href="mailto:golumbic@gmail.com" title="mailto:golumbic@gmail.com">golumbic@gmail.com</a>&gt;:</p>
<p>Dear Holger, Philipp and Morten,<br>
     This January we will celebrate the 30-year anniversary of the<br>
International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics (ISAIM).<br>
I think it might be of interest to CLAIRE members.<br>
      I would like to personally invite you and your colleagues to come<br>
and participate.  Attached is the  CALL FOR PAPERS.</p>
<p>Besides submitting regular papers, I would appreciate receiving proposals<br>
for organizing a special session. As you know, ISAIM is a great<br>
opportunity to gather working groups to start (or finish) new research<br>
papers and collaborations. These proposals should be sent to me.<br>
    Best wishes, Marty Golumbic</p>
<p>============<br>
        ISAIM-2020 – Ft. Lauderdale, Florida (Jan. 6-8, 2020)</p>

<p>The International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics<br>
(ISAIM), is a biennial meeting that fosters interactions between<br>
mathematics, theoretical computer science, and artificial intelligence .<br>
This will be the sixteenth Symposium in the series, sponsored by<br>
Florida Atlantic University and the Annals of Mathematics and Artificial<br>
Intelligence.</p>
<p>We seek submissions of recent results with a particular emphasis on the<br>
foundations of AI and mathematical methods used in AI. Papers describing<br>
applications are also encouraged, but the focus should be on principled<br>
lessons learned from the development of the application. Traditionally, the<br>
Symposium attracts participants from a variety of disciplines, thereby<br>
providing a unique forum for scientific exchange. The three-day Symposium<br>
includes invited speakers, presentations of technical papers, and special<br>
topic sessions.</p>
<p>Work that will have been published as of January 2020 should not be<br>
submitted to ISAIM unless it introduces a significant addition to the<br>
previously published work. However, the ISAIM web site proceedings are not<br>
archival, so papers submitted to ISAIM can be under review elsewhere at the<br>
time of submission and can be submitted elsewhere after ISAIM.</p>
<p>Authors of a selected set of papers from the Symposium will be invited to<br>
submit full versions of their papers for inclusion in an archival special<br>
volume of the Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence,<br>
published by Springer. Those invited submissions will be subject to<br>
refereeing at the usual standards of the journal, and authors will receive<br>
more details with the acceptance notice. Papers must of course be new and<br>
unpublished to be considered for the special volume.</p>

<p>1st INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON LANGUAGE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS (IWLTP 2020) - 16 May 2020 – Marseille, France – co-located with LREC 2020</p>
<p>SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS</p>
<p>Deadline for Submissions: 21 February 2020</p>
<p><a href="https://www.european-language-grid.eu/iwltp-2020/" target="_blank" title="https://www.european-language-grid.eu/iwltp-2020/">https://www.european-language-grid.eu/iwltp-2020/</a> </p>
<p>With the increasing number of platforms, grids and infrastructures in the wider area of Language Technologies (LT), NLP, NLU, speech (including conversational agents), interaction and language-centric AI, there is also a growing need for sharing experiences, approaches and best practices to learn and benefit from the work of others and also, practically, to start a collaboration towards platform interoperability.</p>
<p>The workshop addresses all smaller and larger language grids, language-related infrastructures, platform initiatives (including general and domain-specific) as well as collaborative research projects that touch upon one or more of the topics mentioned below, both in Europe and world-wide. The objective is to assemble representatives of these initiatives and all interested parties to exchange and discuss observations, experiences, solutions, best practices as well as current and future challenges. The workshop also addresses the issue of fragmentation in the Language Technology landscape. Instead of “platform islands” that simply exist side by side, possibly even competing with each other, we want to invite all relevant and interested initiatives to discuss how their platforms can be made interoperable and how they can interact with one another to create synergies towards a productive LT platform ecosystem.</p>
<p>The long-term vision of platform interoperability has several prerequisites including technical requirements that need to be addressed, for example, through the use of common standards, but also community-related aspects that need to be addressed and strengthened through open discussions and further joint development. Both aspects are covered by this workshop.</p>
<p>CONTEXT AND MOTIVATION</p>
<p>The EU project European Language Grid (ELG; 2019-2021) is creating a platform that will provide thousands of data sets and hundreds of LT services. ELG aims to promote technologies tailored to all European languages and cultures, adapted to their social and economic needs.</p>
<p>At the same time, there are several established platforms or infrastructure-related initiatives as well as emerging new ones, both on the international European but also on the national level as well as on other continents. Some of the initiatives are more language-related and have a strong industry focus, others are mainly research-oriented. Moreover, there are digital public service initiatives or platforms in which language is only one aspect of many. </p>
<p>With all these established and emerging initiatives, there is a risk of even stronger fragmentation in the Language Technology field, which is already highly fragmented, at least in Europe. Our approach is to bring these initiatives together to discuss ways not only of preventing further fragmentation but, crucially, of reversing it. This will only be possible if interoperability and mutual data exchange is ensured and if metadata formats and technical requirements are compatible, among various other aspects.</p>
<p>We invite authors to submit contributions<br>
 on the current situation of their platform-related projects or initiatives (including technical, governance, community, uptake, interoperability, social aspects). We especially invite all relevant international or national grid, platform or infrastructure<br>
 projects to participate in the workshop actively with a contribution. </p>
<p>INVITED KEYNOTE</p>
<p>Nancy Ide (Vassar College, USA): “Towards a Global Language Grid – Challenges and Opportunities”</p>
<p>TOPICS OF INTEREST</p>
<p>In the list of topics below, the term “Language Technology (LT)” comprises Natural Language Processing, Natural Language Understanding, all types of speech and conversational technologies, as well as language-centric AI and general AI.
