<p>Mentoring and Communication Program for Starting Researchers (MC4SR) at the <a href="https://digital.ecai2020.eu/">24th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence</a> is plenty of activities for young researchers: <a href="http://ecai2020.eu/aiearlyresearchers/">http://ecai2020.eu/aiearlyresearchers/</a></p>
<p>In particular, pay attention to the call for participation in the Doctoral Consortium which is now open (<strong>Deadline: June 20</strong>). All participants can attend both training and mentoring sessions, but only those with an accepted abstract will have the opportunity to present their work in the mentoring session and receive feedback from senior researchers. The best presentations will be awarded.</p>
<p>If you are a Starting Researcher, please apply <strong>before June 20</strong> at: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ecai2020dc">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ecai2020dc</a>. <br>
If you are a Senior Researcher, please forward this information to your students and encourage them to apply for the Doctoral Consortium.</p>
<p>As announced earlier this week, <a href="https://digital.ecai2020.eu/">ECAI2020</a> will be a great LIVE/GLOBAL/DIGITAL/OPEN event with a rich scientific and social program from August 29 to September 5. Registration for MC4SR is free, allowing access to all the conference contents and activities with no charge at all.</p>
