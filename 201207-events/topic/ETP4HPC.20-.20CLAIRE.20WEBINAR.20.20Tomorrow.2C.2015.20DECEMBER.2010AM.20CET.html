<p>Description:<br>
In December we will explore Artificial Intelligence with our TCI partner CLAIRE, the Confederation of Laboratories for Artificial Intelligence Research in Europe, with a view to better understanding and leveraging its interlock with HPC.</p>
<p>The CLAIRE network gathers 385 labs and institutions. CLAIRE seeks to strengthen European excellence in AI research and innovation. The network forms a pan-European Confederation of Laboratories for Artificial Intelligence Research in Europe. Its member groups and organisations are committed to working together towards realising the vision of CLAIRE: European excellence across all of AI, for all of Europe, with a human-centred focus.</p>
<p>Prof. Dr.-Ing. Philipp Slusallek, co-founder and Member of the Board of CLAIRE, has accepted our invitation to present CLAIRE and  show us the multiple facets of “AI”: the main domains and workflows where AI is being heavily used. Typical  work- and dataflows in our daily lives and in the industry are influenced at many different stages by AI methods and algorithms. An abstracted view of these stages will  help to position the value of AI in our digital continuum.</p>
<p>As usual we will start the webinar with a welcome to new ETP4HPC members. We will host EXAPSYS, a Greek SME, and HypeAccelerator, a UK-based SME.</p>
