<p>Facing the challenge of building trustworthy AI-based software and systems, Europe needs to educate a new generation of bright researchers on the usage of AI in Software Verification and Validation (V&amp;V) and the V&amp;V aspects of AI systems. To reach this goal, we propose to welcome about 30 PhD students in VIVA, the 1st summer school dedicated to AI and Software V&amp;V. High-level courses will be given by the most recognized European researchers in the field of Software V&amp;V and trustworthy Artificial Intelligence and will include an appropriate combination of theoretical and practical matters. The courses will cover a broad spectrum of research topics including Machine Learning and Data Mining in Software Testing, V&amp;V of Neural Networks, Constraint Programming in Verification Testing of Autonomous Systems, etc. The PhD School is co-organized by LIRMM, Simula Research Laboratory and Inria with the financial support of the French Institute in Norway, Simula, Inria and CNRS through the GDR-IA, GDR-MADICS and the GDR-GPL. </p>
