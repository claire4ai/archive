<p>On <strong>Wednesday, October 14</strong>, an online broadcast of a lecture on <strong>Conversational Artificial Intelligence</strong> will take place on the Czech Center London's Facebook from <strong>7 pm</strong>, led by <strong>Jan Šedivý</strong> from the Czech Institute of Informatics, Robotics and Cybernetics, CTU.</p>
<p>During a live stream presentation, Jan Šedivý will discuss Alquist, a social chatbot, which was designed under his leadership by the Czech Technical University team of students. It has won second place twice in a row in the Amazon Alexa Prize competition, while beating more than a hundred international academic teams. Jan will briefly review the competition and its primary motivations but his main focus will be on the Alquist team’s expertise, which embraces several disciplines such as Conversational AI, Dialogue Management, Linguistics, Audio design, Creative writing, and many more. Šedivý will also explain the development of the dialogues for favourite conversational topics and discuss the plans of how to turn Alquist into a product. Discussion after the presentation will be chaired by Dr. Michael Londesborough.</p>
