<hr>
<p><strong> APPLICATION DEADLINE: 5th March 2021 </strong><br>
<a href="https://www.ants-lab.it/mess2020/application/">https://www.ants-lab.it/mess2020/application/</a></p>
<p>MESS 2020+1 is aimed at qualified and strongly motivated MSc and PhD students; post-docs; young researchers, and both academic and industrial professionals to provide an overview on the several metaheuristics techniques, and an in-depth analysis of the state-of-the-art. The main theme of this edition is “Learning and Optimization from Big Data”, therefore MESS 2020+1 wants to focus on (i) Learning for Metaheuristics; (ii) Optimization in Machine Learning; and (iii) how Optimization and Learning affect the Metaheuristics making them relevant in handling Big Data.</p>
<p>Participants will be delivered a certificate of attendance indicating the number of hours of lectures (36-40 hours of lectures). In according to the academic system all PhD and master students attending to the summer school will may get 8 ECTS points. </p>

<p>** METAHEURISTICS COMPETITION</p>
<p>All participants to the school will be involved in the “Metaheuristics Competition”, where each of them will must develop a metaheuristic solution on the given problem. The top three of the competition ranking will receive the MESS 2020+1 prize. Students whose algorithm will rank in the top ten of the competition ranking will be invited to submit a manuscript of their work to be published in the special volume MESS 2020+1 of the AIRO Springer Series.</p>
<p>** SHORT TALK &amp; POSTER PRESENTATION</p>
<p>All participants may submit an abstract of their recent results, or works in progress, for presentation and having the opportunities for debate and interact with leaders in the field. Mini-Workshop Organizers and Scientific Committee will review the abstracts and will recommend for the format of the presentation (oral or poster). All abstracts will be published on the electronic hands-out book of the summer school.</p>
<p>The Abstracts must be submitted by <em>March 5, 2020</em>.</p>
