<p>Abstract: Measuring algorithmic bias is crucial both to assess algorithmic fairness, and to guide the improvement of algorithms. Current methods to measure algorithmic bias in computer vision, which are based on observational datasets, are inadequate for this task because they conflate algorithmic bias with dataset bias. To address this problem I will propose experimental method for measuring algorithmic bias of face analysis algorithms, which manipulates directly the attributes of interest, e.g., gender and skin tone, in order to reveal causal links between attribute variation and performance change. The method is based on generating synthetic “transects” of matched sample images that are designed to differ along specific attributes while leaving other attributes constant. A crucial aspect of our approach is relying on the perception of human observers, both to guide manipulations, and to measure algorithmic bias. Besides allowing the measurement of algorithmic bias, synthetic transects have other advantages with respect to observational datasets: sampling  attributes more evenly, allowing for more straightforward bias analysis on minority and intersectional groups, enabling prediction of bias in new scenarios, reducing ethical and legal challenges, and they are economical and fast to obtain, helping make bias testing affordable and widely available. The method is validated by comparing it to a study that employs the traditional observational method for analyzing bias in gender classification algorithms. The two methods reach different conclusions. While the observational method reports gender and skin color biases, the experimental method reveals biases due to gender, hair length, age, and facial hair.</p>

<p>Abstract: Computers are still largely not connotated with emotional intelligence – even more than two decades after the kick-off of the Affective Computing as the core discipline in this regard. Yet, recently significant advancement took place in the recognition of human emotion and generation of simulated emotional behaviour by computing devices increasingly lending them “Artificial Emotional Intelligence”. This can open up a rich selection of exciting applications to become reality such as completely changing how we interact with computing devices. In this talk, we will dive deep into the latest developments in multimodal Affective Computing from the AI perspective. This includes self-learning of neural architectures by AutoML, reinforcement learning, lifelong and self-supervised learning, “green” efficient learning, federated learning, but also using emotion in learning itself. Furthermore, we will look into robustness issues such as against adversarial attacks or package loss. Beyond showing these and further recent trends and developments largely basing on deep learning techniques, the talk will end on the major needed final steps at “T-minus 3” to make Artificial Emotional Intelligence take-off and “fly” in real-world applications at scale.</p>
