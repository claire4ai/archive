<p>Dear colleagues</p>
<p>We are excited to announce <a href="https://annpr2020.ch/" target="_blank" title="https://annpr2020.ch/">ANNPR 2020</a>, the 9th IAPR TC3 Workshop on Artificial Neural Networks in Pattern Recognition, which will be held from September 2nd-4th, 2020, at <a href="https://www.zhaw.ch/en/university/" target="_blank" title="https://www.zhaw.ch/en/university/">ZHAW</a> in Winterthur. The conference is organized by ZHAW-InIT and sponsored by the <a href="https://data-service-alliance.ch/" target="_blank" title="https://data-service-alliance.ch/">Swiss Alliance for Data-Intensive Services</a>.</p>
<p>The workshop will act as a major forum for international researchers and practitioners working in all areas of neural network- and machine learning-based pattern recognition to present and discuss the latest research, results, and ideas in these areas. ANNPR is the biannual workshop organized by the Technical Committe 3 (IAPR TC3) on Neural Networks &amp; Computational Intelligence of the International Association for Pattern Recognition (IAPR).</p>
<p>Among the previous editions of the workshop were ANNPR 2018 (Siena, Italy), ANNPR 2016 (Ulm, Germany), ANNPR 2014 (Montreal, Canada), ANNPR 2012 (Trento, Italy), ANNPR 2010 (Cairo, Egypt), ANNPR 2008 (Paris, France) and ANNPR 2006 (Ulm, Germany). </p>
<p><strong>Program</strong> </p>
<p>The workshop will consist of keynote talks, several sessions for presentations of accepted papers, and a poster session. Keynote speakers are Jürgen Schmidhuber (tentative, The Swiss AI Lab IDSIA, Lugano, Switzerland), Naftali Tishby (Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel) and Bernd Feisleben (University of Marburg, Germany). </p>
<p>In addition, there will be a dedicated industry session featuring a sponsored keynote, applied research presentations and industry exhibits / booths / demos, which will provide networking opportunities. The social program consists of a welcome reception, an excursion and a conference dinner.</p>
<p><strong>Topics</strong></p>
<p>ANNPR 2020 invites papers that present original work in the areas of neural networks and machine learning oriented to pattern recognition, focusing on their algorithmic, theoretical, and applied aspects. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: </p>
<p>Methodological Issues: <br>
– Supervised, semi-supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning <br>
– Deep learning &amp; deep reinforcement learning <br>
– Feed-forward, recurrent, and convolutional neural networks <br>
– Generative models <br>
– Interpretability &amp; explainability of neural networks <br>
– Robustness &amp; generalization of neural networks <br>
– Meta-learning, Auto-ML </p>
<p>Applications to Pattern Recognition: <br>
– Image classification and segmentation <br>
– Object detection <br>
– Document analysis, e.g. handwriting recognition <br>
– Sensor-fusion and multi-modal processing <br>
– Biometrics, including speech and speaker recognition and segmentation <br>
– Data, text, and web mining <br>
– Bioinformatics and medical applications <br>
– Industrial applications, e.g. quality control and predictive maintenance </p>
<p><strong>Paper Submission (Deadline: May 1st, 2020) </strong></p>
<p>Papers are invited to be submitted via EasyChair. There will be a peer review process before acceptance. The page limit is 12 pages. For instructions, see <a href="https://annpr2020.ch/cfp/" target="_blank" title="https://annpr2020.ch/cfp/">https://annpr2020.ch/cfp/</a>. </p>
<p>Accepted papers will be published as a special volume of the Springer Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) series. For previous editions, see <a href="https://link.springer.com/conference/annpr" target="_blank" title="https://link.springer.com/conference/annpr">https://link.springer.com/conference/annpr</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Organization</strong></p>
<p>The workshop is organized by the Institute of Applied Information Technology (InIT) at the ZHAW School of Engineering. The program committee is listed at <a href="https://annpr2020.ch/organisation/" target="_blank" title="https://annpr2020.ch/organisation/">https://annpr2020.ch/organisation/</a> </p>
<p>Chairs: Dr. Frank-Peter Schilling (chair), Prof. Dr. Thilo Stadelmann (co-chair) </p>
<p><strong>Venue</strong></p>
<p>ZHAW is one of the leading universities of applied sciences in Switzerland, with around 13 000 students and host to one of Europe’s first and largest dedicated research centers for Data Science. ZHAW’s School of Engineering is one of the leading Engineering Faculties in Switzerland. Our 13 institutes and centres guarantee superior-quality education, research and development with an emphasis on the areas of energy, mobility, information and health. </p>
<p>Winterthur is the sixth-largest city of Switzerland with around 110 000 inhabitants. It is located in eastern Switzerland, approximately 20 km from Zurich. The Zurich region is the hub of the digital economy in Switzerland, hosting companies like Google, NVIDIA, IBM and Facebook, which have a high natural affinity to neural networks and pattern recognition. It is also host to world famous universities such as ETH Zurich and University of Zurich UZH, as well as to several universities of applied sciences including the ZHAW. The Swiss AI Institute IDSIA in Lugano, as well as the Swiss Data Science Center SDSC by ETH Zurich and EPFL Lausanne complete the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning landscape in the region.</p>
