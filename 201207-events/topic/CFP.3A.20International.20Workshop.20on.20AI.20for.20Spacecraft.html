<p>Dear colleagues,</p>
<p>We are pleased to invite you to submit your work at the 1st International Workshop on AI for Spacecraft Longevity ( <a href="https://ai4spacecraft.github.io">https://ai4spacecraft.github.io</a> )  to be held in conjunction with IJCAI 2021 <a href="http://tentative%20date%2021-23%20August%202021">https://ijcai-21.org/</a>. The half-day workshop will be an excellent forum for presenting recent AI applications, exchanging ideas and discussing potential challenges on various topics pertaining to spacecraft longevity and endurance. </p>
<p>We welcome original high-quality submissions that describe innovative research relevant (but not limited) to the following topic areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data and knowledge extraction, representation, management and reasoning</li>
<li>Supervised and unsupervised (deep) learning methods for telemetry data</li>
<li>Data mining and analysis of structured and streaming telemetry data</li>
<li>Outlier/Anomaly/Fault detection and prognostics</li>
<li>Architectures for embedded artificial intelligence</li>
<li>Concept and contextual learning from spacecraft housekeeping data</li>
<li>Reinforcement learning for efficient exploration of new environments</li>
<li>Cloud and edge computing in space</li>
<li>Fault-Tolerant Space Processing, Memory, and Storage</li>
<li>Fault and power management approaches</li>
<li>Distributed and collaborative mission planning</li>
<li>Human-machine interactions</li>
<li>Intelligent decision support</li>
<li>Learning to plan, planning to learn</li>
</ul>
<p>With potential applications in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operations-enabling technology in ground and flight systems</li>
<li>Mission planning and management</li>
<li>Spaceflight operations</li>
<li>Autonomous spacecraft operations</li>
<li>Human-centric and explainable AI for operator empowerment</li>
</ul>
<p>We solicit submissions focused on peaceful advancing of humanity, support of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (<a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">https://sdgs.un.org/goals</a>) and space sustainability.</p>
<p>The submission deadline for the workshop is set to May 9th, 2021. The submitted papers should be long up to 3 pages content (+ references). The notification of acceptance is set to May 24th, 2021. Additional workshop details are available at <a href="https://ai4spacecraft.github.io/">https://ai4spacecraft.github.io/</a> (the exact date of the workshop will be announced by the IJCAI 2021 organizing committee). </p>
<p>We hope that you will respond positively to our invitation and submit your work for consideration. We would also like to invite you to share the call for papers in your network of collaborators.</p>
<p>With best regards,</p>
<p>Nikola Simidjievski, Dragi Kocev, Luke Lucas and Ljupco Todorovski<br>
