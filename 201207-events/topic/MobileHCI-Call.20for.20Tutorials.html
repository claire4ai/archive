<p>Message from the Tutorial Chairs:</p>
<p>We invite you to submit proposals for online tutorials that are to be held on the 5th of October during the MobileHCI 2020 conference. We strongly believe that online tutorials provide a great opportunity for our community to reach more researchers, while at the same time improving sustainability and reducing barriers to participation (e.g., due to visa issues). However, in order to face the unique challenges, we are introducing some fundamental changes to our Call for Tutorials:</p>
<p>1) We open tutorials to a broad range of formats in order to engage the online audience.<br>
2) We tackle the issue of different time zones by asking tutorial organizers to specify a time slot that suits their needs and the option to record the tutorial.<br>
3) We explicitly ask for proposals that address topics related to the pandemic.</p>
<p>More Information</p>
<p>For more detailed information please find attached our Call for Online Tutorials as PDF. If you have any further questions about online tutorials at the MobileHCI 2020, contact the Tutorials Chairs at <a href="mailto:tutorials2020@mobilehci.acm.org">tutorials2020@mobilehci.acm.org</a></p>
<p>We look forward to reading your proposals!<br>
Dimitra Anastasiou and Uwe Gruenefeld</p>
