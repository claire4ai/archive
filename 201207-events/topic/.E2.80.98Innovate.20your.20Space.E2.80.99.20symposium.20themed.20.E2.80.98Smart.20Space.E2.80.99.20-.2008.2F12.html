<p>After a successful symposium last year, we are pleased to invite you for our upcoming online TUD-TNO-SRON ‘Innovate your Space’ symposium themed ‘Smart Space’.</p>
<p>We want to focus in this symposium on needs, technologies and approaches for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in the Space Sector and beyond.</p>
<p>We are happy to announce as keynote speakers Raffaella Franco (ESA/ESTEC) and Prof. Dr.Thomas Bäck (Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science),  who will share their insights on the symposium topic, representing two highly relevant organisations. </p>
<p>During a panel discussion we aim to trigger an exchange of ideas on how the various members of the Dutch space and non-space ecosystem can jointly collaborate on this exciting theme.</p>
<p>At the pitch rounds TUD, TNO and SRON researchers will be given the opportunity to pitch their ongoing research on the latest technological innovations.</p>
<p>The program can be found on the website of the <a href="https://spaceinstitute.tudelft.nl/program-innovate-your-space/">TU Delft Space Institute</a>. Please stay up to date since minor changes might occur.</p>
<p>The symposium will take place online from 09:00-12:15 on Tuesday December 8th 2020.</p>
