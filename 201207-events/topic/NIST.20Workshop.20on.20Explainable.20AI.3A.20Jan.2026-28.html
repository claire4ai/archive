<p>NIST will hold a virtual workshop on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (AI). January 26th-28th</p>
<p>Explainable AI is a key element of trustworthy AI and there is significant interest in explainable AI from stakeholders, communities, and areas across this multidisciplinary field. As part of NIST’s efforts to provide foundational tools, guidance, and best practices for AI-related research, we released a <a href="https://www.nist.gov/topics/artificial-intelligence/ai-foundational-research-explainability">draft whitepaper</a>, Four Principles of Explainable Artificial Intelligence, for public comment. Inspired by comments received, this workshop will delve further into developing an understanding of explainable AI.</p>
