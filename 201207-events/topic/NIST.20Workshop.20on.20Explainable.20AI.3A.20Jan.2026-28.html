<p>NIST will hold a virtual workshop on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (AI). January 26th-28th</p>
<p>Explainable AI is a key element of trustworthy AI and there is significant interest in explainable AI from stakeholders, communities, and areas across this multidisciplinary field. As part of NISTâ€™s efforts to provide foundational tools, guidance, and best practices for AI-related research, we released a <a href="https://www.nist.gov/topics/artificial-intelligence/ai-foundational-research-explainability">draft whitepaper</a>, Four Principles of Explainable Artificial Intelligence, for public comment. Inspired by comments received, this workshop will delve further into developing an understanding of explainable AI.</p>
