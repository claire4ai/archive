<p>Live Webinar and Audience Q&amp;A hosted by Impact Entrepreneur</p>
<p>Date: Thursday, May 14th, Noon Eastern</p>
<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence for the Impact Economy</strong></p>
<p>Like the Impact Economy, machine learning transforms established ways of doing business. Recent breakthroughs have made this powerful technology accessible to a whole new range of businesses. Impact entrepreneurs are now using this organizational intelligence to pioneer some truly inspiring applications of artificial intelligence — including helping to combat the coronavirus.</p>
<p>This live webinar and Q&amp;A features senior leaders from four growing businesses deeply involved in applying artificial intelligence for social and ecological impact. We will discuss, among other topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>How machine learning is being used to help tackle the covid-19 pandemic</li>
<li>The kinds of problems for which machine learning is well-suited</li>
<li>Options for impact entrepreneurs in acquiring machine learning expertise</li>
<li>Challenges and opportunities in funding Impact AI</li>
<li>Building funder/customer capacity for understanding and applying machine learning</li>
<li>Opportunities for partnering with philanthropy and NGOs to develop Impact AI</li>
<li>Using mission to compete with well-funded “big tech” to recruit and retain tech talent</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>GIDEON ROSENBLATT</strong> has dedicated much of his working life to promoting the use of technology as a force for good in the world. He worked at Microsoft for nine years in marketing and managing product development teams. He later ran a mission-driven technology consulting group, dedicated to improving citizen engagement across hundreds of environmental organizations in the United States and Canada. He now writes about the impact that machine learning and automation have on the nature of work, the human experience, and society itself. Most of his writing can be found at his website, the Vital Edge (<a href="https://www.the-vital-edge.com/">https://www.the-vital-edge.com/</a>).</p>
