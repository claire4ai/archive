<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="*">@all</span> ,</p>
<p>At the European Space Agency, from the Advanced Concepts Team and we have just finalized the spotGEO competition dataset which we are going to release publicly as a competition for ML and AI. </p>
<p>The competition will run from the 8th of June to th end of August.</p>
<p>In the "Spot the GEO satellites" challenge, or spotGEO challenge, participants will be asked to develop an AI to detect Geostationary orbiting objects from simple png images (or frames) acquired by an unkown, low-cost ground-based telescope. Can AI approaches cope with cloud cover, atmospheric/weather effects, light pollution, sensor noise/defects, star occlusions and more?</p>
<p>Have a look at the <a href="https://kelvins.esa.int/spot-the-geo-satellites/">Competition pages</a> and read also the <a href="https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Engineering_Technology/Telescope-peering_AI_challenged_to_spot_mystery_space_objects">official ESA news</a>.</p>
