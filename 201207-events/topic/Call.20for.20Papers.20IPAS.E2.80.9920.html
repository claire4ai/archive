<p>Extended Deadline<br>
Fourth IEEE International Image Processing, Applications and Systems Conference<br>
<a href="http://ipas.ieee.tn/">http://ipas.ieee.tn/</a><br>
December 16-18 2020, Genova, Italy</p>
<p>The international Image Processing Applications and Systems conference is intended for grouping from all over the world challenging researchers, innovators, academicians, and practitioners in image processing theory and tools, for following high level tutorials, sharing their achievements, exchanging their experiences and discussing future orientations. The conference will also offer an opportunity to make a bridge between image processing researchers and people working in other application fields such as medical doctors, radiotherapists or industrial parts.<br>
 Accepted papers will be submitted for publication in IEEE Explore.</p>

<p>REGULAR PAPER SUBMISSION</p>
<p>The submission and reviews for IPAS 2020 will be handled through the Microsoft Conference Management System. CMT – IPAS2020.<br>
Authors can submit Full papers. Accepted papers will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore.<br>
<a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/IPAS2020/Submission/Manage">https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/IPAS2020/Submission/Manage</a></p>
<p>Manuscript length: 6 pages maximum for Full Paper Submission. This is a strict limit for initial submission. During final submission of accepted papers, authors may purchase extra pages if they find it necessary to address the concerns of the reviewers.<br>
Double blind reviewing: IPAS follows a double-blind review process. Authors are required to include their names and affiliations in a separate document and omit their names and affiliations in their papers as illustrated in IPAS Conference templates. These templates (Microsoft Word and LaTeX) can be found at the following link:</p>
