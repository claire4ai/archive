<p>VUB together with Knoledge4Innovation are pleased to invite you to the upcoming 12 EIS Conference session “AI for the Common Good” that will take place next Friday, 11 December, from 14h00 to 15h00.</p>
<p>This session will be held online, so if you are interested in participating, please register at this link: <a href="https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_VLgZPek_Quqv346l9VomWg">https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_VLgZPek_Quqv346l9VomWg</a><br>
An email from Zoom will follow after registration with the link to join the event.</p>
<p>This session will bring several concrete initiatives and frameworks to the table to show how Trustworthy AI &amp; Data applications can create an impact for society that lasts.</p>
<p>In this session we debate the translation of AI for Good from the application and impact perspective: how AI can serve the Public or Common Good, how it will impact AI research with an emphasis on value-driven innovation, starting from fundamental democratic values like “equality”, “freedom” and “fraternity”. And what does that mean when implementing such innovations, creating applications and services for the public interest? What roles do Governments, Public Administrations play? What can be the role of Open Data and Open Science in all of this? And last but not least, how to involve of the public, social communities, in this process?</p>

It is now clear to all, this current crisis will accelerate digital transformation as well as the impact of AI &amp; Data, driven technologies in all our personal activities as an individual and the society as a whole. Of course, positive aspects of AI and data are most of the time clear, but the concerns and risks as expressed the last years, are the same as before the pandemic of course. These concerns always start by putting our individual values and rights, our democratic society at the center. How can we make sure personal data are secured, individuals can keep control of want their data are being used for and to what benefit and for whom? Are we entereing the world of a new economic paradigm? The European perspective is that we need Human-Centric AI solutions for our economic “relance” and growth, that these technologies need to support SDG’s, provide e.g. quality care, especially to our aging population and solve many societal challenges.
In this session we debate the translation of AI for Good into the application and impact perspective: how AI can serve the Public or Common Good, how it will impact AI research and this with an emphasis on value driven innovation, starting from fundamental democratic values like “equality”, “freedom” and “fraternity”. But what does that mean when implementing such innovations, creating applications and services for the public interest? What role do Governments, Public Administrations play? What can be the role of Open Data and Open Science in all of this and how to involve of the public, social communities, in this process.
This session brings several concrete initiatives and frameworks to the table to show how trustworthy AI &amp; Data applications can create an impact for society that lasts.</div></div></div>
