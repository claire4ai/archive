<p>As AI is becoming more ubiquitous and part of almost every aspect of our lives, professional and personal, it is necessary to consider potential harmful aspects of it: from exploitation of AI weaknesses for nefarious purposes (e.g. adversarial attacks against classifier) to abuses of harmless technologies (e.g. deepfakes to spread misinformation). Reactively addressing these AI mis/ab-uses when they have been already executed has proven to be costly in many dimensions (human, economic, etc.); hence a more preventive approach emerges as an alternative. In this talk we will do a walkthrough of some of these adversarial AI scenarios and how a red team mentality may be a viable strategy, with some examples.</p>
<p>Duration: 60 minutes (including audience Q&amp;A) </p>
