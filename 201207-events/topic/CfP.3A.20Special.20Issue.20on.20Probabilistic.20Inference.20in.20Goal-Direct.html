<p>Special Issue on Probabilistic Inference in Goal-Directed Human and Animal Decision-Making</p>
<hr>
<p>This Special Issue aims to focus on recent advances in probabilistic inference in goal-directed human and animal decision making, and we welcome submissions that: </p>
<ul>
<li>Shed light on the computations of neuronal circuits involved in goal-directed decision making, with a focus on the inferential mechanisms involved;</li>
<li>Propose novel probabilistic models and methods in decision making including (but not limited to) information-theory approaches, statistical and free- energy minimization, hierarchical models, and deep networks; </li>
<li>Introduce decision-making applications in ethological, social, psychological, psychiatric, robotics, and computer science research. </li>
</ul>
