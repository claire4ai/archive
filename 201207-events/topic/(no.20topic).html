<p>Dear CLAIRE friends,<br>
Please find enclosed the CFP for ECAI2020, with my apologies for cross-postings, since many of you may have received it yet.<br>
Apart of the traditional aim of keeping ECAI a premier venue for presenting scientific results for European AI researchers, we are also aiming to make the Conference a meeting point for all the new AI research related initiatives, plans and strategies that are going on now in Europe. In this regard, we think this Call might be of interest to all CLAIRE members.<br>
Many thanks and best regards,<br>
