<p><strong>e-Workshop on GANs for Media Content Generation</strong>, October 1st, 2020, 10:00-14:10 CEST<br>
<a href="https://ai4media.eu/events/gan-media-generation-workshop-oct-2020/">https://ai4media.eu/events/gan-media-generation-workshop-oct-2020/</a></p>
<p>You are welcome to attend FOR FREE the "e-Workshop on GANs for Media Content Generation", on October 1st, 2020, in the framework of EU-funded H2020 R&amp;D project AI4Media: <a href="https://ai4media.eu">https://ai4media.eu</a>.</p>
<p>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are part of the cutting edge in recent machine learning research. Trained by exploiting the interplay between a generative and a discriminative deep neural network, GANs are able to implicitly model the data distribution, thus allowing us to generate realistic data samples after model training is complete.  </p>
<p>The Digital Media sector is perhaps the greatest beneficiary of GAN-based algorithms, with industry-relevant research already taking advantage of their potential. They are useful for a wide range of media-related applications, such as image-to-image translation, optical recognition enhancement, text-to-speech systems, music/image/video generation, video summarization, image anonymization and many others, frequently giving rise to state-of-the-art results.  </p>
<p>On the negative side, the rise of so-called "deep fakes" poses significant new challanges, both ethical and technical, thus making the development of methods to robustly detect them a top priority. Overall, GANs hold the key to revolutionizing the way we produce media and arts content.</p>
<p>The AI4Media project focuses on building a network of research excellence that will deliver the next generation of core AI advances to serve the key sector of Media. In this context, this Workshop is meant to disseminate knowledge regarding GAN-based state-of-the-art for media content generation and for fake media detection. The workshop lectures are at CS/ECE/EE graduate level. MSc/PhD/Postodoc researchers are particularly welcomed from Europe and around the world. </p>
<p>The lectures will be presented live by senior or Postdoc researchers from several AI4Media consortium members and collaborators across Europe. </p>
<p>You can attend using Webex, accessed through the Workshop website:   <br>
