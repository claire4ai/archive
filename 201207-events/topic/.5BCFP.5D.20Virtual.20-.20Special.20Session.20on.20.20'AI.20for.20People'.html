<p>GOODTECHS Steering and Organizing committees, due to the current COVID-19 situation, have decided to make our 2020 Edition fully virtual to eliminate uncertainty and to ensure the health, safety, and well-being of our research community and society in general. </p>
<ul>
<li>Full Paper Submission extended deadline: 1 June 2020</li>

<li>Camera-ready deadline: 30 July 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>Call for Papers</p>
<p>Social good is something that benefits the general public and to the largest number of people. Hence, it can be defined as global citizens uniting to unlock the potential of individuals, technology and collaboration to create positive societal impact. It is about engagement, shareability and bringing people together to change the world for the better. At the same time, Artificial Intelligence (AI) research is mature enough for stable algorithms and approach to be used and play a crucial role in the aforementioned environments, enabling the deployment of revolutionary services and applications. It is envisioned that both the social interaction and the integration with smart devices will meaningfully impact societal development sustainability.</p>
<p>This special session is dedicated to addressing major challenges in realizing intelligent platforms based on recent innovation in AI systems that can provide new ways of approaching problems and meaningfully improve people’s lives. We expect works that focus on the following areas: health, education, protecting democracy, urban planning, assistive technology for people with disabilities, smart and sustainable agriculture/fishing, environmental sustainability, search and rescue operations, emergency management, economic inequality, social welfare, justice, ethics, privacy, and security. The numerous emergent intelligent applications for social good may require an interdisciplinary approach, involving techniques from AI to communication networks, from IoT to data analysis, from social science to complex systems.</p>
<p>Topics</p>
