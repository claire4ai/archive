<p>IDAI 2021 inaugurates a series of yearly Summer Schools organized by the two renowned German and French AI institutes, DFKI and Inria. It stands out from the crowd of offerings for AI students in several respects:</p>
<ul>
<li>We ensure a good balance in the number of participants and instructors: participants will have the opportunity to join a community of like-minded people and, at the same time, they will be in close contact with the experts.</li>
<li>Our program features a line-up of courses focused on two themes, Trustworthy AI and AI for Medicine, which are at the forefront of socio-economic issues related to AI.</li>
<li>On top of the latest methodological advances and the shared vision of the future that both organizing institutes have to offer, IDAI 2021 will be practically oriented. We will achieve this through hands-on courses and the involvement of industry practitioners and innovators.</li>
<li>Participants will be offered to the opportunity to present their work to each other in dedicated poster/demo sessions.</li>
<li>Trustworthy AI and AI for Medicine will take place in two parallel tracks. There will be plenty of opportunities to exchange between these two tracks at coffee breaks, meals and social events, as well as through joint cross-track sessions.<br>
.................................................................</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TARGETED AUDIENCE</strong><br>
IDAI 2021 was designed for PhD students in all areas of AI, including machine learning, knowledge representation and reasoning, search and optimisation, planning and scheduling, multi-agent systems, natural language processing, robotics, computer vision, and other areas. PhD students in other fields, MSc students, postdocs, and researchers in industry are also welcome.<br>
.................................................................</p>
<p><strong>VENUE</strong><br>
IDAI 2021 is currently planned as a fully in-person event, which will take place at the Inria Saclay Île-de-France research center, close to Paris. Remote attendance will not be possible.</p>
<p>In case the sanitary conditions do not allow an in-person event, IDAI 2021 will take place as a fully virtual event at the same dates instead. We are closely monitoring the situation and will strive to make this decision as early as possible.<br>
