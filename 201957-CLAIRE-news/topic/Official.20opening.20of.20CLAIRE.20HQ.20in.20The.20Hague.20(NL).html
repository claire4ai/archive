<p>Yesterday, our administrative headquarters in The Hague (NL) have been officially opened. The Hague, which has a global reputation as "City of Peace and Justice" is an excellent fit for CLAIRE. The opening was attended by more then 100 guests; it featured speeches by representatives of CLAIRE, EurAI, the municipality of The Hague, the Parliament of the Netherlands, the Dutch AI Coalition, Leiden University, Delft University, the European Space Agency (ESA) and the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute (UNICRI), as well as several demos of advanced AI systems.</p>

<p>Africa has structural challenges that can hamper the development of a healthy AI ecosystem in Africa:<br>
• Education systems will need to adapt quickly, and new frameworks need to be created for<br>
workers and citizens to develop the skills they need to thrive.<br>
• Broadband coverage will need to expand rapidly — specifically in rural areas — in order for all<br>
citizens and businesses to reap the benefits.<br>
• Ethical implications regarding the fair, secure, and inclusive use of AI applications also must<br>
be addressed through collaboration and engagement to ensure AI systems earn trust.<br>
• Ensuring a deeper, broader, and more accessible pool of data is available will also be key to<br>
enable researchers, developers, and users to drive AI.<br>
It for these reasons we are using the CLAIRE platform to seek partners and collaborators to bring the benefits of AI to Africa. How can we work together?</p>

<p>Ceasar, Africa has an AI effort already underway. If you would like your university or research entity to be included in the consortium, please let me know.</p>

<p>Thank you for the press release and presentation deck, Alexa. A pity I missed the opening of CLAIRE headquarters last week due personal circumstances, and hoping to get more involved with CLAIRE in 2020. Happy Holidays everyone</p>
