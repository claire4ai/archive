<p>Excellent news from Finland:<br>
1) Finland has just become the 7th EU country whose government officially supports the #CLAIRE vision, and the first Nordic country to do so. Many thanks to our Finnish supporters who made that happen! <br>
2) The Finnish AI Society, FAIS (official national representative of Finland in EurAI) has just pledged its support for CLAIRE.<br>
3) Two national contact points for CLAIRE in Finland have been confirmed by FAIS: Matti Järvisalo (President of FAIS) and Petri Myllymäki (Vice-president of the Finnish Centre for AI).<br>
A warm welcome to Matti and Petri in their new role as national contact points. It's great for all of us to have Finland so strongly involved!</p>
