<p>Dear friends and colleagues,</p>
<p>You may have seen or heard about the open letter CLAIRE to the leaders of the EU and national governments, in which we offer governmental agencies and public institutions support in managing the unfolding COVID-19 crisis in Europe.</p>
<p>The open letter can be found at <a href="http://claire-ai.org/openletter-covid-19" target="_blank" title="http://claire-ai.org/openletter-covid-19">http://claire-ai.org/openletter-covid-19</a> (see also our press release at <a href="http://claire-ai.org/claire-press-release-13" target="_blank" title="http://claire-ai.org/claire-press-release-13">http://claire-ai.org/claire-press-release-13</a>).</p>
<p>In a nutshell, CLAIRE has formed a COVID-19 task-force, led by Emanuela Girardi (IT) and Prof. Gianluca Bontempi (BE), and we are committed to supporting it through all CLAIRE offices. There is plenty of evidence that AI techniques from areas such as data analysis, machine learning, robotics, advanced manufacturing, scheduling and resource management can make a difference in managing the COVID-19 crisis, and the CLAIRE community has much to offer in this regard.</p>
<p>Here is how you can get involved with our effort. At <a href="http://shorturl.at/fjtz5" target="_blank" title="http://shorturl.at/fjtz5">shorturl.at/fjtz5</a>, we made available a spreadsheet where you can let us know about </p>
<ul>
<li>your availability (and that of your research group) in volunteering: note that this is not a formal commitment, but merely a way to let us know that we can contact  you in case of open tasks or requests for help related to your expertise;</li>
<li>public institutions involved in managing the crisis that are interested in collaborating with the CLAIRE community (in particular, ones that you have contacts at or with); </li>
<li>other public initiatives we may want to connect to (in particular, ones that you are involved in or in contact with);</li>
<li>relevant scientific publications or serious news coverage.</li>
</ul>
<p>We would like to move rapidly to an organisation where we share tasks according to application domains (e.g., image analysis of CT scans, data analysis of IC data, robotics, scheduling, ...) and assign a task leader (and subleaders) to each of them.</p>
<p>If you would like to get involved in the COVID-19 taskforce in any other way, or if you have other ideas on how to best be of assistance in this difficult situation, let us know on the <a class="stream" data-stream-id="226112" href="/#narrow/stream/226112-covid-19">#covid-19</a> stream. That stream is also an excellent place for exchanging information on best practices related to the use of AI techniques in dealing with the COVID-19 crisis.</p>

<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>Registering of CLAIRE volunteers for the Covid-19 response and management initiative  and institutions interested in CLAIRE volunteers for Covid-19 Volunteer availability are now communicated via the following forms:</p>
<p>Form for CLAIRE volunteers for Covid-19 response and management: <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdIyubw0t51yudcp4sVcENVhzvSIRcqPFfNVk-UnSbQyAQ1pw/viewform" title="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdIyubw0t51yudcp4sVcENVhzvSIRcqPFfNVk-UnSbQyAQ1pw/viewform">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdIyubw0t51yudcp4sVcENVhzvSIRcqPFfNVk-UnSbQyAQ1pw/viewform</a></p>
<p>Form for Institutions interested in CLAIRE volunteers for Covid-19 response and management: <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfqLhThmq52C3pwXosMqx6Rs2dGLoeLR3zDjGicsrHiby6wog/viewform" title="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfqLhThmq52C3pwXosMqx6Rs2dGLoeLR3zDjGicsrHiby6wog/viewform">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfqLhThmq52C3pwXosMqx6Rs2dGLoeLR3zDjGicsrHiby6wog/viewform</a></p>
<p>We are also looking for volunteers who could build a new, high quality, dynamic website for the taskforce, that can easily be updated to dynamically respond to new content, volunteers and initiatives as we find them. We are platform agnostic - Webflow, Squarespace, Wordpress, Tableau could all potentially work well. But we'd like to get it up and running in the coming days. Please contact the Covid-19 Taskforce, at <a href="mailto:covid19@claire-ai.org" title="mailto:covid19@claire-ai.org">covid19@claire-ai.org</a>.</p>
