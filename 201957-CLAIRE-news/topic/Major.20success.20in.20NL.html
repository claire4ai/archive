<p>Researchers from 20 CLAIRE member groups and institutions, working closely with several ELLIS supporters and other outstanding scientists, just won one of the largest and most prestigious grants in Dutch science. The 10-year, 19M EUR Gravitation project is on hybrid intelligence - AI that aims to augment, rather than replace, human intelligence. This is great news for AI in NL, for AI in Europe, and for CLAIRE. It also shows that when top researchers across different areas of AI join forces, the sky is the limit. <span aria-label="champagne" class="emoji emoji-1f37e" role="img" title="champagne">:champagne:</span><span aria-label="tada" class="emoji emoji-1f389" role="img" title="tada">:tada:</span>üá±üá∫üá™üá∫üåç<br>

<p>The success of this grant proposal also shows what can be achieved when researchers from CLAIRE and ELLIS work closely together towards a common goal, as 5 of the 27 researchers that form the consortium are members of ELLIS.</p>

<p>We certainly hope that this is just the first of many such successes for CLAIRE and for the community at large!</p>
