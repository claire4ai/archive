<p>As a significant number of CLAIRE supporters will be at IJCAI in Macao next week, we have organised a CLAIRE community meeting to take place</p>
<p>11:00-12:30 on Thursday, 15 August, in Room 2405-2406.</p>
<p>During this meeting, we will give a brief update on CLAIRE, including the latest information on our work in the context of several proposals for the ICT-48-2020 call, our collaboration with ESA and the formal establishment of the non-profit CLAIRE organisation. The major part of the meeting will be a working session, during which we'd like to receive your input and discuss with you three topics that we believe will be of interest to you. There is no need to register for the meeting, and if you are at IJCAI, we hope that you will be able to attend the community meeting. We will make sure that there will be a way for anyone who won't be at IJCAI to receive the update and to give your feedback on the topics of discussion (possibly shortly after IJCAI).</p>
