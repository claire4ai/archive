<p><strong>EC AI consultation survey [URGENT]</strong></p>
<p>[<strong>In a nutshell</strong>: Please participate, by <strong>26 November,</strong> in an important EC AI consultation survey; you might want to take inspiration from the CLAIRE analysis outlined below.]</p>
<p>The European Commission has announced (with very little advanced notice) a survey on research topics in AI that should be considered of strategic importance for building European capacity and excellence in AI research. Because the result of the survey is likely to have significant impact on future funding opportunities through EU programmes, we</p>
<p>1 - urge you to complete this survey, and distribute it (along with this message) within your group or institution, and</p>
<p>2 - sketch out an analysis of this survey, in line with the CLAIRE vision of how to maximally strengthen the European AI ecosystem, with suggestions that may inform your response to the survey.  </p>
<p>Whether you find some parts of our analysis inspiring, have different opinions or decide to simply ignore it, what is most important is that you complete the survey. We would have liked to run a broad consultation within CLAIRE (and beyond) to explore this further and build consensus, but the tight timeline set by the Commission makes this impossible.</p>
<p><strong>You can find the survey here:</strong> <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/AI_Excellence_HorizonEurope">https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/AI_Excellence_HorizonEurope</a><br>
<strong>Password: "AI"</strong></p>
<p>The survey can be completed in 5-20 minutes, depending on the level of detail of your response. It closes on <strong>Thursday, 26 November</strong>.</p>
<p>Here are the thoughts and suggestions of the CLAIRE extended core team on the various sections of the survey.</p>
<p><strong>Topic ranking: </strong></p>
<p>We believe that, considering the existing four ICT-48 networks of centres of excellence, as well as the strengths and needs of AI research and innovation in Europe, the highest priorities for <strong>additional </strong>networks of centres of excellence (NoEs) are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Next generation of Smart Robotics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Green AI </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sparking the edge-to-cloud AI revolution. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The other topics, notably Next Generation AI, Human-AI augmentation/collaboration, Trustworthy AI, and Safe and Secure AI, are very important, but covered to a significant extent by the existing NoEs (AI4Media, ELISE, Humane-AI-Net and TAILOR - see <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/towards-vibrant-european-network-ai-excellence">https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/towards-vibrant-european-network-ai-excellence</a>). Rather than funding new NoEs that have considerable overlap with the existing ones, we believe the best strategy is to expand and reinforce the existing ones in these areas. We encourage you to indicate this in your comments.</p>
<p><strong>Missing from the list of topics</strong> are, in our view:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Functional and performance guarantees (theoretical and statistical) for AI systems<br>
(this overlaps with, but goes beyond, Safe and Secure AI)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complex Systems and Social Simulation</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and, to some extent, Natural Language Processing, which may deserve more of a distinct focus than it has in the current NoEs.</p>
<p>We believe that it is very important to add the following<strong> additional comments</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It is of crucial importance to strengthen and expand the current NoEs covering machine learning, reasoning, optimisation, multiagent systems and their combinations, as well as trustworthy AI. To build critical mass in these areas, substantial further investment is needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is of crucial importance to  ensure effective coordination and strong interaction between the existing and new NoEs towards a closely collaborating European AI community. To this end, there should be a joint coordination and integration mechanism that helps to bring together the different networks. It is important that this mechanism is given substantial weight.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To compete globally, for talent, economical impact and societal benefit, the European Commission needs to invest substantially and smartly into AI. It needs to leverage the diversity of European strength in AI, take better advantage of the talent pool across Europe and achieve better cohesion and coordination of the AI ecosystem. By sending a clear and consistent message to the Commission via this survey, you can help make this happen. As we can see from the examples of European institutions like CERN and ESA, cohesion, coordination and a common identity are key to global success. </p>
<p>If you would like to give further comments related to the topic of the survey, feel free to leave them at <a href="http://bit.ly/3nWAyen">bit.ly/3nWAyen</a>; we will compile those into an additional document that we will send to the European Commission (complementing the survey).</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>
