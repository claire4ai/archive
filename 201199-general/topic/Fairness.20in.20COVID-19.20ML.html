<p>The American NSF Project on Fairness in AI looking for ML tools and datasets involved in approaching COVID-19 that are particularly sensitive to ethical concerns about fairness. Our team consists of computer scientists and philosophers tasked with deploying a philosophical understanding of the concept of fairness to analyzing and eventually informing a system designed to keep a human in the loop in order to revise decision-making rules based on the fairness intuitions of its users. </p>
<p>We are available for and invite collaboration with international universities as we endeavor to make ourselves useful in facing this pandemic in ways designed to ensure that no one is left behind. Please get in touch!</p>
