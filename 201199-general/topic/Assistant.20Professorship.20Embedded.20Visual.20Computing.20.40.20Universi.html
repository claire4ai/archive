<p>The Computer Science Institute at the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural<br>
Sciences of the University of Bonn, Germany, invites applications for a</p>
<p><strong>W1-Professorship (Tenure Track W2) for Embedded Visual Computing</strong></p>
<p>starting as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The institute is looking for excellent candidates holding a doctoral degree<br>
who are about to establish their own research agenda, complementing our<br>
current activities in the areas of Visual Computing, Artificial Intelligence,<br>
Intelligent Systems, and Robotics.</p>
<p>Applicants must have demonstrated scientific excellence in at least one of the<br>
following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deep learning for visual computing</li>
<li>Parallel architectures for visual learning or inference</li>
<li>Embedded systems for visual perception or display</li>
<li>Energy-efficient computing</li>
<li>Edge computing</li>
<li>Novel computing paradigms, such as computing with stochastic elements or<br>
  neuromorphic computing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The successful candidate has a strong publication record. It is expected that<br>
the successful candidate actively participates in collaborative research<br>
initiatives of the Computer Science Institute. Initial teaching duties are<br>
four hours per week during lecture periods, e.g., in our English Master<br>
Computer Science programme.</p>
<p>The initial employment of three years will be extended for three more years<br>
after a positive intermediate evaluation. After successful tenure evaluation,<br>
the position will be permanent with W2 denomination. This professorate is<br>
funded by the Tenure Track Program of the German Federal Government and the<br>
Federal States. Awarding tenure is not subject to a vacancy at the time when<br>
the fixed-term contract of the tenuretrack position expires. This call is<br>
aimed at early-career researchers. Candidates must have changed universities<br>
following the doctorate or have been working in academic research outside of<br>
the University of Bonn for at least two years prior to applying. Formal<br>
requirements are defined by $36 of the Higher Education Act of North<br>
Rhine-Westphalia (Hochschulgesetz Nordrhein-Westfalen). Regulations on tenure<br>
track at the University of Bonn and further information on tenure track<br>
professorates at the University of Bonn are available at <a href="https://www.uni-bonn">https://www.uni-bonn</a>.<br>

<p>The University of Bonn actively supports diversity and equal opportunities.<br>
The University of Bonn has been certified as a family-friendly university and<br>
has a dual career service. Its aim is to increase the proportion of women in<br>
those fields in which women are underrepresented and to place a special focus<br>
on promoting their careers. Therefore, the university specifically requests<br>
applications from suitably qualified women. Applications will be handled in<br>
accordance with the Equal Opportunities Act of North Rhine-Westphalia.<br>
Applications from suitably qualified people with severe disabilities that have<br>
already been verified or from people with an equivalent status will be<br>
particularly welcomed.</p>
<p>Applicants are asked to send their applications, including a CV with list of<br>
ten most important publications, full list of publications, research<br>
statement, teaching statement, and copies of degree certificates, as one PDF<br>
file to <a href="mailto:fachgruppe@informatik.uni-bonn.de">fachgruppe@informatik.uni-bonn.de</a>.</p>
<p>Applications received by September 15, 2020 are guaranteed full consideration.</p>
