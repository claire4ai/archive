<p>Interesting Working Paper: <br>
<strong>From a ‘Race to AI’ to a ‘Race to AI Regulation’:  Regulatory Competition for Artificial Intelligence</strong> by Nathalie A. Smuha available at <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3501410" target="_blank" title="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3501410">https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3501410</a></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br>
Against a background of global competition to seize the opportunities promised by Artificial Intelligence (AI), many countries and regions are explicitly taking part in a ‘race to AI’. Yet the increased visibility of the technology’s risks has led to ever-louder calls for regulators to look beyond the benefits, and also secure appropriate regulation to ensure AI that is ‘trustworthy’ – i.e. legal, ethical and robust. Besides minimising those risks, such regulation could facilitate AI’s uptake, boost legal certainty, and hence also contribute to advancing countries’ position in the race. Consequently, this paper argues that the ‘race to AI’ also brings forth a ‘race to AI regulation’. After discussing the regulatory toolbox for AI and some of the challenges that regulators face when making use thereof, this paper assesses to which extent regulatory competition for AI – or its counterpart, regulatory convergence – is (1) a possibility, (2) a reality and (3) a desirability.</p>

<p>"Recent research in artificial intelligence and machine learning has largely emphasized general-purpose learning and ever-larger training sets and more and more compute. In contrast, I propose a hybrid, knowledge-driven, reasoning-based approach, centered around cognitive models, that could provide the substrate for a richer, more robust AI than is currently possible." </p>

<p><strong>Principled Artificial Intelligence - Mapping Consensus in Ethical and Rights-based Approaches to Principles for AI</strong> by Berkman Klein Center</p>
<p>This white paper and its associated data visualization compare the contents of thirty-six prominent AI principles documents side-by-side. This effort uncovered a growing consensus around eight key thematic trends: privacy, accountability, safety and security, transparency and explainability, fairness and non-discrimination, human control of technology, professional responsibility, and promotion of human values. </p>

<p><strong>MIT Tech Review: The global AI agenda: Promise, reality, and a future of data sharing</strong></p>
<p>A new survey of 1,000 AI leaders reveals the top use cases, the challenges of building scale, and the potential benefits of data sharing.</p>
<p>Among the organizations surveyed for this report, 72% had begun deploying AI by 2018, and 87% by 2019. Yet much remains unknown about AI’s real, as opposed to potential, impact. Companies are developing use cases, but far from all are yet bearing fruit. How, business leaders ask, can we scale promising use cases to multiple parts of the enterprise? How can we leverage data, talent, and other resources to exploit AI to the fullest? And how can we do so ethically and within the bounds of regulation?</p>
