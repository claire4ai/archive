<p>As part of the collaborative efforts of CLAIRE, do we have a plan for pooling resources for compute clusters with, e.g., lots of cutting edge GPUs so that academics from smaller institutions can also participate in resource intensive research? At the moment, my impression is that the solution is to (1) let megacorps handle GPU-intensive research or (2) have students do internships at said companies.</p>

<p>Dave, I can't speak to CLAIRE's intentions on this matter but I was wondering if you have engaged with the Hartree Centre for the use of their compute platform?<br>
At present we are working on a compute platform to serve all the research efforts for universities in Africa, and access will be extended to include collaborations with universities and international entities beyond Africa. In this regard, I look forward to CLAIRE participation/collaboration. The collaboration framework agreement is being  drafted by Wits University and I have asked Wits to include CLAIRE as a potential participant. <br>
I am happy to include your university as well, as well as any other interested university - as we see this as a way to significantly bolster international collaboration between Africa and the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Thank you, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="237208">@Gregg Barrett (Cirrus)</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="238486">@Emilia Tantar</span> for your pointers. I'm very interested in following developments in this space, although I don't think I have the time to contribute actively to this organizing.</p>
<p>Seeing the concentration of AI research at these large companies concerns me, as their goal is not to serve society in the same way that university research is meant to. Given that CLAIRE has been compared to CERN before, I thought this kind of capital-intensive shared research infrastructure might be a goal of the organization.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="238061">@Dave Howcroft (Heriot-Watt University, UK)</span> we are currently working on the consortium of universities and research entities. Participants in the consortium will have access to all the infrastructure and programs we are putting in place as well as the opportunity to engage in substantive international collaboration. <br>
I am going to engage with CLAIRE on this to understand if there is preference (and the ability) to have CLAIRE as a participant in the consortium or whether interested universities and research entities that are within the CLAIRE domain would be invited individually. <br>
Dave, let me know if your university would be interested in joining the consortium? We already have collaborations with several of the UK's top universities which will form part of the consortium.</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="237208">@Gregg Barrett (Cirrus)</span> for following up. Do I understand correctly that this consortium is in some sense separate from CLAIRE? Or would it be under the CLAIRE umbrella but specifically for organizations who enter into a particular series of commitments? (With the broader CLAIRE community including both individuals (like myself) and institutions which support the mission and may participate in events but don't necessarily join this consortium.)</p>
<p>I've just joined Heriot-Watt in June as a postdoc, so I don't know about the existing level of involvement of folks here. I'll ask around and get back to you.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="238061">@Dave Howcroft (Heriot-Watt University, UK)</span> The consortium under discussion pertains to Africa's AI initiative - which includes participation of universities and research entities from all around the world. So the consortium is separate to CLAIRE but the objective is to support and collaborate with CLAIRE as best we can. <br>
Concerning participation (which I am going to raise with the CLAIRE team) it could be done through CLAIRE (if the legal structure permits) and then all those participating in CLAIRE will be included, or we could work with CLAIRE and have individual universities and research entities that are participating in CLAIRE each join the consortium individually. <br>
In both instances the objective is the same - to make our resources available and foster collaboration.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="237208">@Gregg Barrett (Cirrus)</span> Thanks for the clarification! I didn't understand that the consortium you were referring to was the Hartree Center.</p>
