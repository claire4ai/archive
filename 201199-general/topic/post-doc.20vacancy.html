<p>Hello all,<br>
We are looking for a post doc researcher. We would be grateful if you could forward this message to anyone that comes to mind.</p>
<hr>
<p>The ADA (Automated Design of Algorithms) research group at Leiden University in collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA-ESRIN) is looking for a post-doc research fellow for a 2-year research project. The post-doc fellow will be employed by Leiden University working mainly at the ADA research group jointly supervised by prof. Holger Hoos, dr. Mitra Baratchi, and a local supervisor from ESA (ESRIN). Upon agreement, the candidate will spend some time at ESA (ESRIN) near Rome (up to 6 months). This position considers scientific research in the area of automated algorithm configuration, in particular for applications in earth observation systems. Currently, radio transfer models (RTMs) are used widely for earth observation studies to extract biophysical parameters of interest from satellite imagery. Advanced and accurate RTMs, however, are extremely computationally expensive. This fact hinders their usage for critical applications (e.g. event and disaster detection) that require usage of RTMs in an online manner by directly running them on a satellite board. The post-doc researcher employed for this project will perform research on this topic by investigating the possibilities offered by recent advancements in the area of automated algorithm configuration, surrogate-based and Bayesian optimization for creating efficient and fast RTM emulators. </p>
<p>This position includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stable research funding for 2 years with a possibility of extension.</li>
<li>A generous travel budget for visit and research stay at ESA (ESRIN), near Rome.</li>
<li>Cutting-edge research in an internationally competitive research group. </li>
</ol>
<p>Interested applicants are invited to immediately contact dr. Mitra Baratchi (<a href="mailto:m.baratchi@liacs.leidenuniv.nl" title="mailto:m.baratchi@liacs.leidenuniv.nl">m.baratchi@liacs.leidenuniv.nl</a> ) and prof. Holger Hoos (<a href="mailto:hh@liacs.nl" title="mailto:hh@liacs.nl">hh@liacs.nl</a>) by sending their CVs. Further documents (research plan, etc.) need to be provided upon request (before 30 of October 2019).post doc vacancy</p>
