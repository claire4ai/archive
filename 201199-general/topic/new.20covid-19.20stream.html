<p>Dear Holger, this is just a great idea. The CIIRC team of Prof. Zdenek Hanzalek is now entering discussion with Czech officials to possibly implement the planning and scheduling algorithm for hospitals to mitigate the risk of insufficient resources (esp. beds with ventilation assistance). If anyone would like to contribute or is interested in this topic, please contact directly prof. Zdenek Hanzalek (<a href="mailto:Zdenek.Hanzalek@cvut.cz" title="mailto:Zdenek.Hanzalek@cvut.cz">Zdenek.Hanzalek@cvut.cz</a>).</p>

<p>Now we have a prototype of the respirator printed on a 3D printer with MJF technology. First tests are very promising and have shown minor improvements to be done. After the final prototype is verified we will focus on finding a way how to ensure mass production. One possibility is to design a form for the injection molding process. We will appreciate anyone who is experienced in designing the injection molding forms to discuss the requirements needed for a proper form to be produced. We expect the form could be also produced with additive manufacturing.The weight is 35g. With filter it will be around 50g. It fits well and seems to be well sealed.<br>
It seems we are going a good direction.<br>

<p>CIIRC RP95 Respirator. March 16: 3D print and molding combination - prototype upgraded<br>
We have implemented silicon molding technology to produce sealing components and the valve. Silicon valve seems to be much better. The respirator fits perfectly and is very comfortable. Tomorrow we will fix the filters. We have already selected the manufacturer of the N95 certified nanomaterial. They are producing the ready made filters for the CIIRC RP95 respirator, we shall have it tomorrow. Tomorrow we, hopefully, will thus have the final prototype and will initiate the official approval procedure with the responsible authorities. Please use central email (above) for any communication. We are recievening so many important comments, which is fantastic! Thank you so much!</p>

<p>CLAIRE is working to collect the “AI &amp; Covid-19” projects and efforts in Europe and to build and organise a network of AI experts and volunteers to work on these projects. </p>
<p>AI technologies can be a great support in fighting the corona virus, by working together, we can show the potential of AI, create a positive impact and ultimately share the best practices within the EU and the world.</p>
<p>Information on how to participate are coming soon. </p>
<p>Here is an interesting initiative.</p>
<p>The Allen Institute for AI has partnered with leading research groups to prepare and distribute the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), a free resource of over 29,000 scholarly articles, including over 13,000 with full text, about COVID-19 and the coronavirus family of viruses for use by the global research community.<br>
This dataset is intended to mobilize researchers to apply recent advances in natural language processing to generate new insights in support of the fight against this infectious disease. The corpus will be updated weekly as new research is published in peer-reviewed publications and archival services like bioRxiv, medRxiv, and others.<br>

<p>CIIRC RP95 respirator, update on March 18: the final prototype delivered to the Czech certification testing lab. Preliminary tests of the mask went well. We however need to change filters. We are in discussion with the filter manufacturer. The final test of the respirator will be performered hopefully today, if we find the proper solution for filters.</p>

Safe Paths is an app that tells you if you have crossed paths with somebody who is infected, it shares information about your movements in a privacy-preserving way—and could let health officials tackle coronavirus hot spots. It is the “privacy compliant” version of the Chinese and South Korean app to track the movements of infected people.<br>
It is a free and open-source app and it has  been developed by a team at MIT Media Lab and Harvard. <br>
