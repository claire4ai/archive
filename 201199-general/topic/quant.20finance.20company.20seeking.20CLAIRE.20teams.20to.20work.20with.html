<p>I work for G-Research, a quantitative finance research company in London. </p>
<p>Over the past 20 years, we have grown organically within the UK, often recruiting on the basis of word-of-mouth and our reputation from the UK’s top universities.</p>
<p>We have reached the point where we are actively recruiting from continental Europe – both to maintain our high standards and to ensure that we bring diverse perspectives to our research.</p>
<p>We are therefore seeking to understand how to support leading continental research groups and effectively recruit from them.  As we are investing heavily in ML, we would like to support CLAIRE teams.</p>
<p>I am therefore trying to identify CLAIRE teams that might be interested in working with us, and then to understand how we could work together.</p>
<p>At present, we run:<br>
1.  a PhD prize for students in Oxford and Cambridge: we plan to extend it beyond these universities.  <br>
2.  a 10 week summer internship, which is open to all, but whose timing might be more suited to UK students.<br>
3.  an internal ML seminar series<br>
We are also becoming more active in supporting open source projects.</p>
<p>Beyond this, we would love to hear creative proposals to identify, develop and recognise young ML talent in Europe.</p>
<p>If you thought that there might be scope for working together, we would be eager to hear from you on the e-mail address below.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance,</p>
<p>Colin Rowat<br>
European Relationships and External Research Manager<br>
