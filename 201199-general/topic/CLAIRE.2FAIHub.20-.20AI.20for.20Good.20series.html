<p><strong>CLAIRE and AIhub partner to launch focus series on “AI for Good”</strong><br>
We are excited to announce that, in partnership with CLAIRE, <a href="http://AIhub.org">AIhub.org</a> (<a href="https://aihub.org/">https://aihub.org/</a>) will be launching a focus series on “AI for Good” which will specifically concentrate on AI research relating to the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs). Each month we will focus on a different one of the goals and highlight work in that area by researchers in the field.<br>
To start the series, we will focus on the SDG “good health and well-being”. </p>
<p><strong>Are you interested in getting involved?</strong><br>
We are looking for researchers who work in healthcare and AI who are interested in writing or talking about their work. You could write (or describe on video) a short blog post about your research, write an opinion piece about an area of current interest, give a tutorial, or take part in an interview. If you are interested, please do get in touch at <a href="mailto:aihuborg@gmail.com">aihuborg@gmail.com</a>.</p>
