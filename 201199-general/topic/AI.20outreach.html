<p>I am Andreas, the director of IMAGINARY, a non-profit organisation for the communication of mathematical research (see <a href="https://about.imaginary.org">https://about.imaginary.org</a>). We are currently involved in many AI outreach projects, namely:</p>
<p>1) a digital exhibition format explaining core AI methods to a general public (multi-language), launching on June 10, 2020 at <a href="http://www.i-am.ai">www.i-am.ai</a><br>
2) a physical and fully open-source traveling exhibition, planned to start in 3 German cities (now postponed, probable start in 2021)<br>
3) AI workshop content for schools and general public (started during the German Science Year of AI)<br>
4) several (some getting more concrete) ideas of starting an open source AI museum<br>
5) networking with other organisations communicating AI (doing outreach, planning exhibitions). There is another AI exhibition project in the pipeline in France, etc.</p>
<p>We would be happy to include the CLAIRE community more in these projects and also promote Claire through AI outreach. At the moment, we would be happy to have interested researchers for input/feedback on our exhibits and connecting them to current research questions. We are also very interested in all types of ongoing AI outreach projects at your institutes.  If there is interest, we could start an AI outreach channel here too. <br>
All the best, Andreas</p>
