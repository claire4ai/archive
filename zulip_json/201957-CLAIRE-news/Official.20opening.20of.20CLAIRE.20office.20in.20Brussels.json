We have therefore decided to postpone the event and will decide on a new date as soon as the situation allows us to run it in such a way that it will create a broad and impactful discussion on the future of AI research and innovation in Europe and CLAIRE's role in achieving that.</p>\n<p>Also in light of the present situation in Europe, we have decided to mobilise the CLAIRE network to provide assistance with efforts in containing and managing the COVID-19 outbreak that may benefit from AI and IT expertise, on a volunteer basis.</p>",
