The major part of the meeting will be a working session, during which we'd like to receive your input and discuss with you three topics that we believe will be of interest to you. There is no need to register for the meeting, and if you are at IJCAI, we hope that you will be able to attend the community meeting. We will make sure that there will be a way for anyone who won't be at IJCAI to receive the update and to give your feedback on the topics of discussion (possibly shortly after IJCAI).</p>",
