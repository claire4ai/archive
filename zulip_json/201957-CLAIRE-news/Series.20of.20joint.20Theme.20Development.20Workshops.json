The main objective of these TDWs is to ﻿bring together researchers, industry representatives and other stakeholders to identify industrial as well as societal trends and needs, and match these to AI capabilities in Europe. Further information can be found in the attached information leaflet.  </p>\n<p>Please encourage the corresponding experts within your organisation to pre-register for the TDWs, and feel free to also forward this information to your contacts who might be interested to participate. This will help us to identify those topics which are of most interest to our community as well as the corresponding stakeholders, thus ensuring that the TDWs can be organised to the benefit of its participants and CLAIRE. </p>\n<p>Thank you very much for your support and kind regards, <br>\nCLAIRE Office Germany </p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/13862/No_ZQr1zuw_bUhDr2Iw8kKet/2020_12_TDW_Announcement_final.pdf\">2020_12_TDW_Announcement_final.pdf</a></p>",
