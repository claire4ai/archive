The 10-year, 19M EUR Gravitation project is on hybrid intelligence - AI that aims to augment, rather than replace, human intelligence. This is great news for AI in NL, for AI in Europe, and for CLAIRE. It also shows that when top researchers across different areas of AI join forces, the sky is the limit. <span aria-label=\"champagne\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f37e\" role=\"img\" title=\"champagne\">:champagne:</span><span aria-label=\"tada\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f389\" role=\"img\" title=\"tada\">:tada:</span>üá±üá∫üá™üá∫üåç<br>\nMore information on the project can be found at <a href=\"https://www.hybrid-intelligence-centre.nl\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hybrid-intelligence-centre.nl\">https://www.hybrid-intelligence-centre.nl</a>.</p>",
