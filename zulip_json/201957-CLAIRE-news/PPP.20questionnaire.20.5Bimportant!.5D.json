We believe the PPP will provide opportunities for realising parts of the CLAIRE vision (<a href=\"http://claire-ai.org/claire-vision\">http://claire-ai.org/claire-vision</a>); as you may recall, this is based on three principles (all of AI, across all of Europe, with a human-centred focus), three organisational levels (a network of laboratories for AI research and innovation, larger regional centres, and a central hub or \"lighthouse centre\"), and two overarching focus areas, AI for Good and AI for All. </p>\n<p>The questionnaire presents an opportunity for us all -- and for you especially -- to communicate the parts of our views and our vision we believe are of importance for the future of AI in Europe (and therefore for the PPP and its policy document, the SRIDA). We encourage you to be clear and direct in your answers.  </p>\n<p>For all questions, you may in particular also want to comment on the role the planned PPP should play for European AI.  Section 7 is meant to collect topics that are not  addressed currently, but that you feel are of importance. – for instance, how the PPP could relate to key objectives like a network of centers of excellence and the lighthouse (central hub), as mentioned in the Commission's white paper.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we'd like you to know that there will be an <strong>opportunity to further discuss the PPP or ask questions related to it during the (virtual) event CLAIRE is running at ECAI, on Friday, 4 September, 10:45 </strong>(more information on this will be made available soon on the ECAI and CLAIRE web sites and on Zulip).</p>\n<p>-<br>\nWith kind regards, <br>\nHolger, Morten and Philipp (on behalf of the CLAIRE Extended Core Team)</p>\n<p>-<br>\n(For a more detailed introduction to the PPP please refer to our e-mail message from 18 August.)<br>\n-</p>\n<p><strong>Reference material: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The questionnaire (<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/DeepDiveAIQuestionnaire\">https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/DeepDiveAIQuestionnaire</a>) to solicit your input with regard to AI in the SRIDA</li>\n<li>A microsite describing the initiative: <a href=\"https://ai-data-robotics-partnership.eu/\">https://ai-data-robotics-partnership.eu/</a></li>\n<li>An information session on July 16 (<a href=\"https://register.gotowebinar.com/register/6763504349053564686\">https://register.gotowebinar.com/register/6763504349053564686</a>) and another on July 29 (<a href=\"https://register.gotowebinar.com/register/7880979797804538894\">https://register.gotowebinar.com/register/7880979797804538894</a>) organised by BDVA</li>\n<li>Partnership proposal application: <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/research_and_innovation/funding/documents/ec_rtd_he-partnerships-artificial-intelligence-data-robotics.pdf\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/research_and_innovation/funding/documents/ec_rtd_he-partnerships-artificial-intelligence-data-robotics.pdf</a> </li>\n<li>Preliminary Strategic Research, Innovation and Deployment Agenda (“SRIDA”), second consultation release, September 2019: <a href=\"https://bdva.eu/sites/default/files/AI%20PPP%20SRIDA-Second%20Consultation%20Release-September%202019%20-%20Online%20version.pdf\">https://bdva.eu/sites/default/files/AI%20PPP%20SRIDA-Second%20Consultation%20Release-September%202019%20-%20Online%20version.pdf</a> </li>\n<li>Ten recommendations from CLAIRE for a co-programmed European partnership in AI: <a href=\"https://claire-ai.org/ten-recommendations-for-an-ai-cpp/\">https://claire-ai.org/ten-recommendations-for-an-ai-cpp/</a></li>\n</ul>",
