We are especially interested in</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Incremental reasoning and learning especially stream reasoning,</li>\n<li>\n<p>spatio-temporal reasoning and learning for example about trajectories<br>\nand events/activities,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>multi-agent reasoning and learning for example combinatorial<br>\nassignment and multi-agent multi-objective reinforcement learning, and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>reasoning and learning for Trustworthy AI such as privacy-preserving<br>\nsynthetic data generation and run-time verification for safe autonomous<br>\nsystems.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At least one of the postdocs will work on developing new machine learning methods for creating privacy preserving synthetic spatio-temporal trajectory data sets. The goal is to 1) extend generative adversarial network (GAN) methods to learn generative spatio-temporal trajectory models and 2) develop new Bayesian Optimization methods for creating tailored privacy-preserving synthetic data sets using these generative models.</p>\n<p>We welcome applicants that have their own research ideas that are aligned with the research group.</p>\n<p>For more information and to apply see:<br>\n<a href=\"https://liu.se/en/work-at-liu/vacancies?rmpage=job&amp;rmjob=15680&amp;rmlang=UK\">https://liu.se/en/work-at-liu/vacancies?rmpage=job&amp;rmjob=15680&amp;rmlang=UK</a></p>\n<p>The application deadline is March 8. It would be good if you can start after the summer (or earlier). It is possible to start working remotely if needed.</p>\n<p>If you want to know more please get in touch!</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://liu.se/en/work-at-liu/vacancies?rmpage=job&amp;rmjob=15680&amp;rmlang=UK\" style=\"background-image: url(https://liu.se/dfsmedia/dd35e243dfb7406993c1815aaf88a675/33478-50065/lediga-jobb-largepuff-191107-liu-rekryteringsannonser-6okt-davideinar-0887-19957?as=1&amp;w=640&amp;h=360&amp;cr=1&amp;crw=640&amp;crh=360&amp;bc=%23ffffff)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://liu.se/en/work-at-liu/vacancies?rmpage=job&amp;rmjob=15680&amp;rmlang=UK\" title=\"Vacancies\">Vacancies</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Take your next step along your career path with us.
