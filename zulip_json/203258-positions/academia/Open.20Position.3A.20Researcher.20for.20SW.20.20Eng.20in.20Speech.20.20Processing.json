Goal of the project is a system that will \"simulate\" a kid in a police interview (i.e. an animated avatar plus speech recognition). Each simulated kid has a story that is based on true cases, and a personality that prompts its behaviour. Our system will be a key means in the education of the police officers, such that they can become better suited for real-life interviews with children.</p>\n<p>For more details, see <a href=\"https://www.zhaw.ch/en/jobs/vacant-positions/job-details/job/detail/ANWI7782.1/\">https://www.zhaw.ch/en/jobs/vacant-positions/job-details/job/detail/ANWI7782.1/</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://www.zhaw.ch/en/jobs/vacant-positions/job-details/job/detail/ANWI7782.1/\" style=\"background-image: url(https://www.zhaw.ch/storage/shared/hochschule/open-graph/job.jpg)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://www.zhaw.ch/en/jobs/vacant-positions/job-details/job/detail/ANWI7782.1/\" title=\"Research Assistant for Software Engineering in Speech Processing | ZHAW Zurich University of Applied Sciences\">Research Assistant for Software Engineering in Speech Processing | ZHAW Zurich University of Applied Sciences</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">School of Applied Linguistics</div></div></div>",
