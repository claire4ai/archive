The core objectives of NoBIAS are to understand legal, social and technical challenges of bias in AI-decision making, to counter them by developing fairness-aware algorithms to automatically explain AI results, and to document the overall process for data provenance and transparency.</p>\n<p>Locations of the positions: Germany, Greece, Italy, United Kingdom, Belgium.</p>\n<p>GESIS-1: Socio-technical networks of bias generation (GESIS-Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences, Cologne, Germany)<br>\nKULEUVEN-1: Discovering biased representations of people (KU Leuven, Belgium)<br>\nCERTH-1: Discovering and quantifying bias (CERTH, Thessaloniki, Greece)<br>\nUNIPI-1: Causality analysis of data for domain-specific bias understanding (University of Pisa, Italy)<br>\nL3S-1: Documenting bias in data through ontologies (Leibniz University Hannover, Germany)<br>\nOU-1: Data enrichment for mitigating bias (Open University, United Kingdom)<br>\nCERTH-2: Bias mitigation in classification methods (CERTH, Thessaloniki, Greece)<br>\nGESIS-2: Bias mitigation in ranking methods (GESIS, Germany).<br>\nIRI-1: Legal issues of mitigating bias at a national and EU level (Leibniz University Hannover, Germany)<br>\nECS-2: Explaining prediction models by argumentation (University of Southampton, United Kingdom)<br>\nSCHUFA-1: Explaining white-model predictions (SCHUFA, Germany)<br>\nECS-1: Collective elicitation of bias coming from inaccessible algorithms (University of Southampton, United Kingdom)<br>\nUNIPI-2: Declarative explanation of black-box decisions (University of Pisa, Italy)<br>\nLS-1: Combining a technical, legal, and ethical assessment of the rights to information and explanation (University of Southampton, United Kingdom)<br>\nL3S-2: Time-dependent monitoring and mitigation for bias (Leibniz University Hannover, Germany)</p>",
