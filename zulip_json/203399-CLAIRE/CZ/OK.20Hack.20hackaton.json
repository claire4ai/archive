One of the judges is Jan Šedivý from CIIRC CTU.</p>\n<p><span aria-label=\"time\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f557\" role=\"img\" title=\"time\">:time:</span> September 9 - Registration closes<br>\n<span aria-label=\"time\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f557\" role=\"img\" title=\"time\">:time:</span> October 2-4 - OKHack hackaton</p>\n<p>What are the challenges? <br>\nArtificial Intelligence (AI)<br>\nDo you have an idea how to use AI to modernize a work attendance control system? Can you use artificial intelligence over an extensive database of input texts to classify them, for example by their negative and positive expressions? Or to classify texts according to content into other groups? Can you create a mobile application that recognizes labels on wine bottles and uses it to search for them on a shelf or in a warehouse? Can you think of another way to use AI for OKsystem? There are no limits to creativity!</p>\n<p>Blockchain<br>\nBlockchain is a hot topic almost everywhere, but few people know how to use it in practice. Can you design and implement a blockchain for a service or even multiple OKsystem services to make them even more reliable? Can you build a system for secure online signing of contracts based on blockchain technology? Or do you have an idea for using blockchain in modern HR management systems? Feel free to implement any of your ideas for using blockchain within any of OKsystem’s products and beyond.</p>\n<p>Break the code<br>\nDo you have what it takes to test the security of OKsystem services and products? For example, OKsystem has built the most secure communication tool on the market – BabelApp. Will you be able to penetrate its security? Can you send a false signal and take over an industrial robot controlled by the Checkbot application from the OKsystem software house?</p>\n<p>More information: <a href=\"https://www.vyrabimeprogramy.cz/en/okhack\">https://www.vyrabimeprogramy.cz/en/okhack</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://www.vyrabimeprogramy.cz/en/okhack\" style=\"background-image: url(https://www.vyrabimeprogramy.cz/images/okhack-fb.jpg)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://www.vyrabimeprogramy.cz/en/okhack\" title=\"30 years of developing software | OKsystem\">30 years of developing software | OKsystem</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Our Company has 30th anniversary!
