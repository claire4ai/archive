At the moment, my impression is that the solution is to (1) let megacorps handle GPU-intensive research or (2) have students do internships at said companies.</p>",

In this regard, I look forward to CLAIRE participation/collaboration. The collaboration framework agreement is being  drafted by Wits University and I have asked Wits to include CLAIRE as a potential participant. <br>\nI am happy to include your university as well, as well as any other interested university - as we see this as a way to significantly bolster international collaboration between Africa and the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>Hartree Centre: <a href=\"https://www.hartree.stfc.ac.uk\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.hartree.stfc.ac.uk\">https://www.hartree.stfc.ac.uk</a><br>\nWits University: <a href=\"https://www.wits.ac.za\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.wits.ac.za\">https://www.wits.ac.za</a></p>",

I'm very interested in following developments in this space, although I don't think I have the time to contribute actively to this organizing.</p>\n<p>Seeing the concentration of AI research at these large companies concerns me, as their goal is not to serve society in the same way that university research is meant to. Given that CLAIRE has been compared to CERN before, I thought this kind of capital-intensive shared research infrastructure might be a goal of the organization.</p>",

We already have collaborations with several of the UK's top universities which will form part of the consortium.</p>",
