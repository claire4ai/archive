The Centre's mission is to enable socially responsible, ethical and legally appropriate implementations of AI with a particular focus on Flanders. <br>\nFor this reason, we will publish a <strong>series of factsheets (brAInfood)</strong> which are small pieces of information on the AI debate to provide the basic information for discussing about AI. In particular we aim to reach Journalists, SMEs and industry, Policy makers and Teachers.</p>\n<p>Our first factsheet outlines AI definitions from different countries and stakeholders (currently only in Dutch: <a href=\"https://www.data-en-maatschappij.ai/uploads/brAInfood.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.data-en-maatschappij.ai/uploads/brAInfood.pdf\">https://www.data-en-maatschappij.ai/uploads/brAInfood.pdf</a>), while the second brAInfood will explain some key terms in relation to AI. </p>\n<p><strong>I attach the draft version and our team would be extremely grateful to receive corrections and critical remarks by the CLAIRE community.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>We also collect further topics for factsheet publications and would equally appreciate any advice from your side.</strong></p>\n<p>Since we published the brAInfood under a creative commons license, we strongly encourage the CLAIRE community to distribute and <strong>make use of the fact sheets for your audience</strong>. Ou factsheets will be published both in Dutch and English due to the fact that the discussion around AI is partly also inaccessible to the larger society because of language barriers for non-native EN speakers. </p>\n<p>If you have the same impression and maybe would like to translate the factsheets into other European languages, or if you have any general questions, please do not hesitate to directly message me, or send me an email to <a href=\"mailto:rosanna.fanni@vub.be\" title=\"mailto:rosanna.fanni@vub.be\">rosanna.fanni@vub.be</a> . Many thanks and we look forward to your improvements!</p>\n<p>Best regards from Brussels,<br>\nRosanna &amp; team <a href=\"user_uploads/13862/DZt3xUrHBZXrhSgbnMiAzkBZ/Factsheet-AI-2.docx\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"user_uploads/13862/DZt3xUrHBZXrhSgbnMiAzkBZ/Factsheet-AI-2.docx\">Factsheet-AI-2.docx</a></p>",
