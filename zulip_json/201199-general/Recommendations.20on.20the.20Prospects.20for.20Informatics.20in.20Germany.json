They are now available for download at the following address: <a href=\"https://www.wissenschaftsrat\">https://www.wissenschaftsrat</a>. en/download/2020/8675-20.pdf. </p>\n<p>The Science Council has analysed the development and current situation of academic informatics and identified three challenges which it has made recommendations for addressing. Personnel shortages are central to all areas. However, the topic is also the handling of the high dynamics in development inside and outside the discipline as well as the fact that computer systems and products now permeate all areas of life. </p>\n<p>Printed copies of the recommendations can be requested by e-mail (<a href=\"mailto:beer@wissenschaftsrat.de\">beer@wissenschaftsrat.de</a>) from the office of the German Council of Science and Humanities.</p>",
