Each month we will focus on a different one of the goals and highlight work in that area by researchers in the field.<br>\nTo start the series, we will focus on the SDG “good health and well-being”. </p>\n<p><strong>Are you interested in getting involved?</strong><br>\nWe are looking for researchers who work in healthcare and AI who are interested in writing or talking about their work. You could write (or describe on video) a short blog post about your research, write an opinion piece about an area of current interest, give a tutorial, or take part in an interview.
