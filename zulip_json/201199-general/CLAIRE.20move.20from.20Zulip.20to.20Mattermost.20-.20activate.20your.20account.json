To facilitate exchange between these networks, and to stimulate synergy and convergence within the European AI communities, VISION and CLAIRE have jointly set up a Mattermost communication platform that is fully hosted in Europe. </p>\n<p>This Mattermost installation is kindly hosted by Inria and jointly administered with CIIRC, with the intention to establish it as the central communication hub for AI research and innovation in Europe. As such, AI communities beyond the ICT-48 projects and CLAIRE are invited to join the platform to facilitate communication and exchange across different parts of the European AI communities and its stakeholders. </p>\n<p>To support this effort, CLAIRE is moving from the Zulip communication platform to the new Mattermost setup, where we are administrating a Mattermost Team that is accessible to all CLAIRE members and supporters. The conversations hosted in Zulip will remain accessible as an archive, but new posting will be disabled on Monday, 26 July, 15:00 CEST.</p>\n<p><strong>Procedure for joining</strong></p>\n<p>If you already have a Mattermost account on <a href=\"http://talk.vision4ai.eu\">talk.vision4ai.eu</a> (e.g. because you are a member of the ICT-48 networks TAILOR or VISION) you'll be added automatically to the CLAIRE team.</p>\n<p>If you did not yet have an account, we have created one for you based on your name and email.
