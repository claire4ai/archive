        "content": "<p>At the European Council summit in July, the EU’s national leaders agreed on a compromise about the EU long-term budget that entails a massive cut to the planned budget for the next framework programme Horizon Europe, and potentially for the <strong>ERC</strong>. <br>\nA potentially disastrous threat for the future of Europe’s research, at a time when research is needed more than ever and when political leaders claim that the success of their policies will depend on research and innovation. There is a considerable gap with the ambitions expressed.</p>\n<p><strong>See the ERC President Jean_Pierre Bourguignon speech on this topic:</strong> <a href=\"https://erc.europa.eu/news/hearing-itre-european-parliament\">https://erc.europa.eu/news/hearing-itre-european-parliament</a> </p>\n<p>The research community and the ERC are currently working very hard to achieve an important revision of this compromise.
