In this respect, it is key that the European Commission takes firm action, removes overbearing policy and regulatory obstacles, strenuously harmonizes relevant legislation and provides concrete incentives and mechanisms for access, sharing and re-use of data. The article argues that to ensure an efficiently functioning European data-driven economy, a new and as yet unused term must be introduced to the field of AI &amp; law: <strong>the right to process data for machine learning purposes.</strong></p>\n<p>Blog: <a href=\"https://airecht.nl/blog/2020/the-right-to-process-data-for-machine-learning-purposes-in-the-eu\">https://airecht.nl/blog/2020/the-right-to-process-data-for-machine-learning-purposes-in-the-eu</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://airecht.nl/blog/2020/the-right-to-process-data-for-machine-learning-purposes-in-the-eu\" style=\"background-image: url(http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b7877457c9327fa97fef427/5b79a7044fa51a76f361e402/5f173db5ecfcf943997a2abe/1595363520889/?format=1500w)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://airecht.nl/blog/2020/the-right-to-process-data-for-machine-learning-purposes-in-the-eu\" title=\"The Right to Process Data for Machine Learning Purposes in the EU\">The Right to Process Data for Machine Learning Purposes in the EU</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Harvard Law School, Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Technology (JOLT) Online Digest 2020, Forthcoming    New interdisciplinary Stanford University AI &amp; Law research article: “ The Right to Process Data for Machine Learning Purposes in the EU ”.
