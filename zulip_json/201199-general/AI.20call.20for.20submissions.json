I examine how government, universities and private companies facilitate the transition of research results to market in the USA. In the report I present various programs that are available to the researchers and entrepreneurs in the US and invite to consider them for implementation in Europe. I argue that different stages of lab-to-market transfer require different mechanisms that should not be limited to funding but include technology transfer assistance and advice on intellectual property, mentoring by peers and industry mentors and access to the laboratory space and incubators. I conclude that the Bay Area answer to closing the lab-to-market gap is by a combination of support mechanisms that reinforce and complement each other, when implemented simultaneously. I invite to discuss which of the US initiatives and programs described in this report shall be promoted in Europe and at which level.</div></div></div><div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://physics.aps.org/articles/v13/15\" style=\"background-image: url(https://physics.aps.org/assets/d383df0a-6bec-4311-807f-feca923a6600/e15_1_thumb.png)\" target=\"_blank\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://physics.aps.org/articles/v13/15\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Focus: Green Light for Terahertz Movies\">Focus: Green Light for Terahertz Movies</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">A new technique uses long-wavelength infrared radiation to produce video with a high frame rate, which could be useful for nondestructive testing of products.</div></div></div>",
