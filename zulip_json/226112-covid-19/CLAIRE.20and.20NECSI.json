I have included the note below that was sent out together with Yaneer’s contact details.<br>\n………….</p>\n<p>The New England Complex Systems Institute has warned for years that increases in global connectivity have made pandemics more likely. Our warnings have proven correct yet again, as the novel coronavirus outbreak has now spread to six continents. </p>\n<p>The same complexity science that predicted this outbreak can be used to contain it. Our researchers are studying the spread of the disease, and we are working to provide comprehensive guidelines to governments and communities affected by the virus. To further our efforts, we are asking for your participation.</p>\n<p>As was the case in the West African Ebola outbreak, community-level interventions are the best containment strategy. To that end, we have begun coordinating teams of volunteers around the world. These teams are building a new website to consolidate information about the disease, performing analytics on case numbers and infection rates, and facilitating channels of communication in multiple languages.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in joining our volunteer network, send an email to yaneer at necsi dot edu with suggestions of what you can do to help.
