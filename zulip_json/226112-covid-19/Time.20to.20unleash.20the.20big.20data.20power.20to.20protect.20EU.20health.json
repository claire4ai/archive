        "content": "<p>Thanks Holger for this thread. <br>\nNow that, after several hesitations, several EU states (including France and Belgium) took restrictive actions, the economy will necessarily slow down. However let us consider that EU will keep producing the most important resource to understand this disease and help protect our health system: DATA. You probably  heard already of Chinese predictive systems to distinguish conventional from covid pneumonia from x-ray imaging but several other tasks may be imagined to help protecting EU health system:<br>\n1) use of causal inference to assess the impact of restrictive actions on epidemics<br>\n2) predict the probability of positive slabs  from observable features (to prioritize the treatment)<br>\n3) predict the risk of positive patients to prioritize the access to IC.</p>\n<p>I think that CLAIRE is a great opportunity to join forces against our common enemy. Please use this thread to share ideas, data, skills, resources and demands for collaboration/support. Several scientists are ready to help.  Stay smart! Stay safe!</p>",

Meanwhile, it would be great to see the channel used exactly as Gianluca suggests. I also feel that expertise in planning, scheduling, resource allocation and optimisation should soon become useful.</p>",

In that sense a definition of volunteering (to avoid stupid IP issues, make easier the access to confidential data, avoid misunderstanding and/or the risks of hidden agenda) made by CLAIRE would be extremely useful/recommended. It is the moment to suspend/postpone our personal short term objectives and federate in a higher long-term perspective. I hope companies and governmental institutions will take an active role as well. I am sure Holger has the good contacts ;-) to have the message passing through. Otherwise, an open letter to the scientific community would help.</p>",

I believe, in line with the call of Gianluca, it is worthwhile to mention here the initiative of GO-FAIR: the Virus Outbreak Data Network (VODAN).<br>\nMore info you can find here: <a href=\"https://www.go-fair.org/implementation-networks/overview/vodan/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.go-fair.org/implementation-networks/overview/vodan/\">https://www.go-fair.org/implementation-networks/overview/vodan/</a><br>\nIt seems a good way forward to link up to this initiative, push forward this approach to create FAIR (in this sense also meaning Federated, AI–Ready) data where the CLAIRE community can work with in contributing to the search for adequate solutions in the field of healthcare &amp; prevention. In its turn, these sets can be linked with other (non-clinical) data sets to look for potential AI driven solutions in logistics and planning and communication actions (fake news!) as well</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://www.go-fair.org/implementation-networks/overview/vodan/\" style=\"background-image: url(https://www.go-fair.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image1.png)\" target=\"_blank\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://www.go-fair.org/implementation-networks/overview/vodan/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Virus Outbreak Data Network (VODAN) - GO FAIR\">Virus Outbreak Data Network (VODAN) - GO FAIR</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Active GO FAIR Implementation Network The spread of the virus causing the COVID-19 outbreak is far from over. During this epidemic and in earlier occasions, we have seen severely suboptimal data management and data reuse.
