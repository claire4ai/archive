As the AI Experience Centre comprises four different multidisciplinary research groups, some affiliated researchers have also been heavily involved in creating solutions for the different challenges our society was recently faced with. As such, the Centre found itself in a unique position since it has had a front-row seat to witness the AI-driven challenges our scientists worked on. For this reason, we have created a webinar series where the audience can learn about the key take-aways from the crisis across several sectors.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://experience-centre.ai/vub-ai-webinar-series-about-the-fight-against-covid-19/\" title=\"https://experience-centre.ai/vub-ai-webinar-series-about-the-fight-against-covid-19/\">https://experience-centre.ai/vub-ai-webinar-series-about-the-fight-against-covid-19/</a></p>",
