Our tool/framework can be managed and explored also via a web interface. We are working with a customer on such problem, but of course this does not prevent the chance of collaborating on it. </p>\n<p>On Friday we also submitted a joint SME Instrument EU project on this topic. </p>\n<p>You may find some of these papers at my home page<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.star.dist.unige.it/~marco/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.star.dist.unige.it/~marco/\">http://www.star.dist.unige.it/~marco/</a></p>\n<p>In particolar the most recent is:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.star.dist.unige.it/~marco/Data/19rulemlrr.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.star.dist.unige.it/~marco/Data/19rulemlrr.pdf\">http://www.star.dist.unige.it/~marco/Data/19rulemlrr.pdf</a></p>\n<p>Marco Maratea</p>",
