In my group, we are retrieving data (cohort of 50K patients). Even if they are not COVID data (and  we have (luckily) not yet a similar cohort ) I was thinking that it could be interesting to use them as baseline to analyse major differences with COVID patients.  If you have any suggestion on this matter, contact me.
