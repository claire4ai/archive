Thanks to AI technologies we had been able to contrast the development of Covid-19 and to better manage and evaluate the impact of the measures taken by governments to face the crisis. Today, several countries are entering or evaluating Phase 2: how can we safely start going out again, without risking a come-back of the pandemic. <br>\nAI technologies can be used to track the movements of the public and re-build the contacts someone infected has had. Identifying these people, testing them and if necessary, quarantining them will prevent a further diffusion of Covid-19 and help us to move freely again. It is recommended that a single solution will be adopted in Europe. And it is also recommended that the chosen solution will respect the privacy of EU citizens.  There are several solutions under development, a quite interesting one is PEPP-PT, developed by a team of 130 academic in 8 EU countries, which analyzes Bluetooth signals between mobile phones to detect users who are close enough to infect each other. That data will be temporarily stored on the phones and if the users will later test positive for the virus, the app alerts anyone who has been around them in preceding days.<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.pepp-pt.org/\" title=\"https://www.pepp-pt.org/\">https://www.pepp-pt.org/</a></p>",
