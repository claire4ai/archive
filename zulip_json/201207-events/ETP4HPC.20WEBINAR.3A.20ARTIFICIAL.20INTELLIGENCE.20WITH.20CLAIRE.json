TCI describes the defining characteristic of the infrastructure required for the convergence of data and compute capabilities in many leading edge industrial and scientific use scenarios (see <a href=\"https://www.etp4hpc.eu/transcontinuum-initiative.html\">https://www.etp4hpc.eu/transcontinuum-initiative.html</a>). Prof. Dr.-Ing. Philipp Slusallek, co-founder and Member of the Board of CLAIRE,  will present CLAIRE and  show us the multiple facets of “AI”: the main domains and workflows where AI is being heavily used. Typical  work- and dataflows in our daily lives and in the industry are influenced at many different stages by AI methods and algorithms. An abstracted view of these stages will  help to position the value of AI in our digital continuum.</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://claire-ai.org/\" style=\"background-image: url(https://claire-ai.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/logo-green.png)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://claire-ai.org/\" title=\"Home | CLAIRE\">Home | CLAIRE</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Confederation of Laboratories for\r\nArtificial Intelligence Research in Europe  \r\nExcellence across all of AI.</div></div></div>",
