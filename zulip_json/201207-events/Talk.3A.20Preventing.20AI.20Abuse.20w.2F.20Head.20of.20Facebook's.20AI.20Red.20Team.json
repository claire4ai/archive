Reactively addressing these AI mis/ab-uses when they have been already executed has proven to be costly in many dimensions (human, economic, etc.); hence a more preventive approach emerges as an alternative. In this talk we will do a walkthrough of some of these adversarial AI scenarios and how a red team mentality may be a viable strategy, with some examples.</p>\n<p>Duration: 60 minutes (including audience Q&amp;A) </p>\n<p>**Presenter:<br>\nCristian Canton**, Facebook AI Red Team<br>\nCristian Canton is a Research Manager on the AI Integrity Team at Facebook AI.
