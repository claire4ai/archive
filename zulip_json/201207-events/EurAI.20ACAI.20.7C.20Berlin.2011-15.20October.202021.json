It postulates a vision of AI beneficial to humans on both individual and social level that is characterized by a focus on supporting and empowering humans as well as incorporating “by design” adherence to appropriate ethical standards and values such as privacy protection, autonomy (human in control), and non-discrimination. Stated this way (which is how it mostly appears in the political debate) it may seem more like a broad, vague wish list than a tangible scientific/technological concept. Yet, at a second glance, it turns out that it is closely connected to some of the most fundamental challenges of AI which are the core of ACAI2021 program</p>\n<p>The program is packed with diverse activities, including tutorials (at basic and advanced level), keynotes, panels, student presentations, and more.</p>\n<p>Confirmed keynote speakers include Yoshua Bengio (Turing Prize Winner) and Ben Schneidermann and the winner of EURAI’s dissertation award 2021.</p>\n<p><strong>Call for tutorials: </strong>ACAI 2021 invites proposals for tutorials. Deadline for proposals is 15 June 2021.
