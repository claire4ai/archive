As BNAIC/BENELEARN 2020 organizers, we are carefully evaluating the situation, following the government line, and aim to provide a conference that is convenient for everyone to participate. </p>\n<p>According to the government plans, during the allocated dates meetings of up to 100 persons will be allowed, with the possibility of further relaxations. If this regulation does not change, we aim to host BNAIC/BENELEARN 2020 in a hybrid form combining on line and on-site participation. Note that due to the specific COVID-regulations in November, the scale of the physical event could be smaller than usual. </p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\nJan van Rijn and Mitra Baratchi on behalf of the organizing committee</p>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<p>HYBRID CONFERENCE</p>\n<p>We are committed to ensure inclusion of everyone in the community. Some people might not feel comfortable traveling to a physical conference amidst the current crisis. We are trying to find a good trade-off between keeping the high level of interaction and networking BNAIC and BENELEARN are known for, as well as providing options for people to be included, even without being physically present. We are therefore committed to offer all presentations online, as well as giving the speakers the option of online presentation. We are investigating other steps that could be taken in that direction. Please contact us in case you have ideas or suggestions. </p>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT INFORMATION</strong><br>\nPaper submission deadline: August 28, 2020<br>\nAuthor notification: October 5, 2020<br>\nCamera ready submission deadline: October 26, 2020<br>\nAll deadlines are at 23:59, AoE time zone.<br>\nConference: November 19-20, 2020</p>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>SUBMISSION INFORMATION</strong><br>\nResearchers are invited to submit unpublished original research on all aspects of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Additionally, high-quality research results already published at international AI/ML conferences or in AI/ML journals are also welcome. Four types of submissions are invited:<br>\nType A: Regular papers<br>\nPapers presenting original work that advances Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. In addition to papers on original work, position and review papers are also welcomed. These contributions should address a well-developed body of research, an important new area, or a promising new topic, and provide a big picture view. Type A papers can be long or short. Long papers should be 10-15 pages, short papers 6-10 pages. Contributions will be reviewed on overall quality and relevance.<br>\nType B: Compressed contributions<br>\nAbstracts of already published work. Papers that have been accepted after June 1, 2019 for AI/ML-related refereed conferences or journals can be resubmitted and will be accepted as compressed contributions. Authors are invited to submit the officially published version (without page restriction) together with a 2-page abstract. Authors may submit at most one type B paper of which they are the corresponding author.<br>\nType C: Demonstrations<br>\nDemonstration abstracts. Proposals for demonstration should be submitted as a 2-page abstract together with a short video illustrating the working of the system (not exceeding 15 minutes). Demonstrations will be evaluated based on their originality and innovative character, the technology deployed, the purpose of the systems in interaction with users and/or other systems, and their economic and/or societal potential. Any system requirements should also be mentioned.<br>\nType D: Thesis abstracts<br>\nAbstracts of graduation reports. Bachelor and Master students are invited to submit a 2-page abstract of their completed AI/ML-related thesis. Supervisors should be listed. The thesis should be accepted after June 1, 2019.
