Can Europe still play a global leadership role in AI? What needs to be done to ensure European interests and sovereignty in this area? And what are the pitfalls along the way? This talk offers a perspective on different possible futures of \"AI made in Europe\" and the conditions under which we are likely to find ourselves in each of these. It is informed by the speaker's extensive experience as an internationally leading AI researcher, his background in the North American and European AI research ecosystem, and his leadership role in CLAIRE, which coordinates the world's largest AI research network and works closely with the European Commission and other stakeholders in European AI.</p>",
