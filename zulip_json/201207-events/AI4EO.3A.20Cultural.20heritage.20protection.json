The goal of the challenge is to explore the potential of the Sentinel satellite data (Sentinel 1 and 2), in combination with the available lidar data, for integrated image segmentation in order to locate and identify “lost” ancient Maya settlements (aguadas, buildings and platforms), hidden under the thick forest canopy. The effort is aimed towards the use of AI and EO towards the protection of the cultural heritage. </p>\n<p>The competition is organised as ECML PKDD 2021 Discovery Challenge “Discover the mysteries of the Maya” (<a href=\"https://2021.ecmlpkdd.org/?page_id=1647\">https://2021.ecmlpkdd.org/?page_id=1647</a>). The winners of the competition, beside being invited to present their solutions at this year's ECML PKDD 2021 Discovery Challenge Track, will also receive money prizes. The competition deadline is July 1st, 2021.
