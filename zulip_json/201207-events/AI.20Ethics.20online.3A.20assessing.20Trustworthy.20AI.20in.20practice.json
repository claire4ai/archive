So far, the process has been used to as​sess AI systems in healthcare. In this talk Roberto will report the main lessons learned in assessing several use cases for trustworthy AI in healthcare, namely:<br>\n– AI for predicting Cardiovascular Risks<br>\n– Machine learning and supportive tool to recognize cardiac arrest in emergency calls <br>\n– Deep learning based Skin Lesion Classifiers</p>\n<p>​​​​Starting march 2021 will work on this new use case: Deep Learning for predicting a multi-regional score conveying the degree of lung compromise in COVID–19 patients.</p>\n<p>Link to registration<br>\nZoom link will be sent out to registered participants.<br>\n<a href=\"https://ui.ungpd.com/Surveys/79f457c4-94b0-423b-ad12-be775825a9fc\">https://ui.ungpd.com/Surveys/79f457c4-94b0-423b-ad12-be775825a9fc</a></p>\n<p>About AI ETHICS at Chalmers<br>\nA series of seminars highlighting ethical perspectives of artificial intelligence. The series will feature invited speakers and Chalmers researchers with the aim of cultivating an informed discussion on ethical issues.
