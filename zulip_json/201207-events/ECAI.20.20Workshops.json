One of the first results of the<br>\nAI-HLEG has been to deliver ethics guidelines on Artificial Intelligence<br>\n(<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/ai-alliance-consultation/guidelines\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/ai-alliance-consultation/guidelines\">https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/ai-alliance-consultation/guidelines</a>).<br>\nThese guidelines put forward a human-centered approach to AI, and list<br>\nseven key requirements that human-centered, trustworthy AI systems<br>\nshould meet, summarized by the following headers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Human agency and oversight</li>\n<li>Technical robustness and safety</li>\n<li>Privacy and data governance</li>\n<li>Transparency</li>\n<li>Diversity, non-discrimination and fairness</li>\n<li>Societal and environmental wellbeing</li>\n<li>Accountability</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Many of today's most popular AI methods, however, fail to meet these<br>\nguidelines: making them compliant is a scientific endeavor that is as<br>\ncrucial as it is challenging and stimulating.  Systems based on deep<br>\nlearning are a case in point: while these systems often provide<br>\nimpressive results, their ability to _explain_ these results to the user<br>\nis very limited, challenging requirements 4 and 7; in most cases we lack<br>\nways to formally _verify_ their correctness and assess their boundary<br>\nconditions, challenging requirement 2; and we don't yet have methods to<br>\nallow humans to _collaboratively_ influence or question their decisions,<br>\nchallenging requirement 1.  Similar criticalities are present in many<br>\nother popular AI methods.</p>\n<p>This full day workshop will collectively address the fundamental<br>\nquestions of what are the scientific and technological gaps that we have<br>\nto fill in order to make AI systems _human-centered_ in terms of the<br>\nabove guidelines.</p>\n<p>PAPER SUBMISSION</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Contributions are seeked on new foundations for building Human-Centered<br>\nAI systems, able to comply with AI-HLEG recommendations.  Contributions<br>\nare seeked in the form of full papers (max 7 pages plus references)<br>\npresenting mature results, or position papers and reports of relevant<br>\nongoing work (max 4 pages including references).  More specific topics<br>\ninclude, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Explainable AI</li>\n<li>Verifiable AI</li>\n<li>Technical robustness and safety of AI systems</li>\n<li>Collaboration between humans and AI systems</li>\n<li>Integrating model-based and data-driven AI</li>\n<li>Integrating symbolic- and sub-symbolic AI</li>\n<li>Mixed initiative AI-Human systems</li>\n<li>Proactive AI systems in human environments</li>\n<li>Understanding and naturally interacting with humans</li>\n<li>Understanding and interaction in complex social settings</li>\n<li>Reflexivity and expectation managament</li>\n<li>Integrating Learning, Reasoning and Acting in AI systems</li>\n<li>Integrating human and robot cognition</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Papers should be formatted according to the ECAI2020 formatting style,<br>\navailable at the ECAI2020 website (<a href=\"http://ecai2020.eu\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://ecai2020.eu\">ecai2020.eu</a>).

How to develop explainable and interpretable AI decision processes? How to develop transparent AI systems and integrate them into the decision process for increasing user trust?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Learning, reasoning and optimisation: How to integrate AI paradigms and representations for reasoning, learning and optimisation in order to support trustworthy AI?

The workshop features invited and contributed research advancing the formal and cognitive foundations of human-centred computing particularly from the viewpoints of theories and methods developed within the fields of:</p>\n<p>—  Artificial Intelligence<br>\n—  Cognitive Science - Psychology<br>\n—  Cognitive Neuroscience<br>\n—  Visuospatial Cognition and Computation<br>\n—  Human-Computer Interaction<br>\n—  Design Science - Design Cognition</p>\n<p>The principal emphasis of the workshop is on:</p>\n<p>(a). the formal and computational foundations of AI and Cognitive Technologies with a principal emphasis on human-centred knowledge representation, semantics, commonsense reasoning, integration of reasoning &amp; learning, and visuospatial representation and reasoning. A particular focus is on integrated commonsense reasoning &amp; learning about space and motion in human-scale embodied multimodal interaction.</p>\n<p>(b). behavioural / empirical methods in cognitive science &amp; psychology and neuroscience aimed at investigating human intelligence from the viewpoints of embodiment, multimodal interaction, and visuospatial thinking. A special emphasis of the workshop is on visuospatial cognition and computation, e.g., in the backdrop of aspects pertaining to visual perception, high-level event perception, motion, and narrative-driven perceptual sensemaking.</p>\n<p>Particular themes of high interest solicited by the workshop include:</p>\n<p>—  knowledge representation - semantics - commonsense - declarative methods<br>\n—  semantic interpretation of multimodal human behaviour data<br>\n—  integration of reasoning and learning - explainability - neurosymbolism<br>\n—  synergy of computational and behavioural / empirical methods<br>\n—  data-centred methods for psychology - psychology-driven AI - ``in the wild'' naturalistic experimentation<br>\n—  embodiment - visuospatial thinking - motion &amp; interaction - visuospatial perception and cognition<br>\n—  design science - design cognition and computation - designing embodied cognitive experiences</p>\n<p>The workshop emphasises:  </p>\n<p>(i).  <code>In-the-wild'' ecologically valid naturalistic (embodied multimodal interaction) settings;  \n(ii).  Bottom-up interdisciplinarity, e.g., combining methods in AI and cognitive psychology; and  \n(iii). Design-thinking as a human-centred perspective for engineering (</code>usable'') cognitive technologies aiming to assist, empower, and augment human capability. </p>\n<p>We welcome contributions addressing the workshop themes from formal, cognitive, computational, engineering, empirical, psychological, and philosophical perspectives.</p>\n<p>/  SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS  /  </p>\n<p>Submitted papers must be formatted according to ECAI 2020 guidelines (refers to workshop website). <br>\nContributions may be submitted as:</p>\n<p>—  Technical papers <br>\n—  Position / vision statements <br>\n—  Work in progress reports or ``new'' project / initiative positioning<br>\n—  Poster abstract     (e.g., for early stage PhD candidates) <br>\n—  System demonstrations</p>\n<p>Details online.</p>\n<p>/  IMPORTANT DATES IN 2020  /  </p>\n<p>We encourage expression of interest and / or registering an abstract and title (anytime before full submission deadline):</p>\n<p>—  Submissions: March 15<br>\n—  Notification: April 15<br>\n—  Camera Ready: May 10<br>\n—  Workshop Date: To be announced<br>\n—  ECAI 2020 Conference: June 8 - 12 2020</p>\n<p>/  WORKSHOP CHAIR  /  </p>\n<p>Mehul Bhatt (Örebro University, Sweden)<br>\nPlease direct all inquiries to  &gt;  [  <a href=\"mailto:mehul.bhatt@oru.se\" title=\"mailto:mehul.bhatt@oru.se\">mehul.bhatt@oru.se</a>  ]</p>\n<p>Workshop details  &gt;  <a href=\"http://www.codesign-lab.org/ecai2020/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.codesign-lab.org/ecai2020/\">http://www.codesign-lab.org/ecai2020/</a></p>\n<p>================================<br>\nApologies for cross-postings.<br>\n================================</p>",
