Specifically, the workshop will not only look into the new approaches going beyond the current achievements in deep learning (e.g., lifelong and continuous learning, moving beyond Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), manifold and transfer learning, neural architecture search, quantum-assisted learning, the fusion of evolutionary algorithms and deep learning), but also, the present solutions for decentralised and distributed computation.</p>\n<p>The main goal is to address the current limitations of learning approaches and improve speed and performance.</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://www.ai4media.eu/event/ai4media-workshop-on-new-learning-paradigms-distributed-ai/\" style=\"background-image: url(http://www.ai4media.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Agenda-Ai4Media_tv_20210428-02-02-781x1024.png)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://www.ai4media.eu/event/ai4media-workshop-on-new-learning-paradigms-distributed-ai/\" title=\"AI4Media Workshop on New Learning Paradigms &amp; Distributed AI - AI4media\">AI4Media Workshop on New Learning Paradigms &amp; Distributed AI - AI4media</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">&nbsp; 4 May 2021, from 08:55 to 13:10h On May 4th, AI4Media will organise an online workshop on “New Learning Paradigms &amp; Distributed AI”, where the recent research advances achieved in the project on new learning paradigms will be presented.
