However, the research community has started to address this problem in other contexts such as regression, ordinal classification, multi-label and multi-class classification, association rules mining, multi-instance learning, data streams, time-series and spatio-temporal forecasting, text mining and multimodal data. Clearly, the research community recognises that imbalanced domains are a broad and important problem. Such a context poses important challenges for both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, in an increasing number of real-world applications.</p>\n<p>Tackling the issues raised by imbalanced domains is crucial to both academia and industry. To researchers, it is an opportunity to develop more adaptable and robust systems/approaches for very complex tasks. These tasks are, in many cases, those that the industry is already facing today. These are very diverse and include the ability to prevent fraud, to anticipate catastrophes, and in general to enable a more preemptive action in an increasingly fast-paced world.</p>\n<p>This workshop proposal focuses on providing a significant contribution to the problems of learning with imbalanced domains, aiming to increase the interest and the contributions to solving its challenges. The workshop invites inter-disciplinary contributions to tackle the problems that many real-world domains face nowadays. With the growing attention that this challenge has collected, it is crucial to promote its further development in order to tackle its theoretical and application challenges.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The research topics of interest to the LIDTA'2021 workshop include (but are not limited to) the following: </p>\n<p>*** Foundations of learning in imbalanced domains<br>\nProbabilistic and statistical models<br>\nNew knowledge discovery theories and models<br>\nProbabilistic and statistical models<br>\nNew knowledge discovery theories and models<br>\nDeep learning<br>\nHandling imbalanced big data<br>\nOne-class learning<br>\nLearning with non-i.i.d. data<br>\nRare event detection in classification tasks<br>\nNew approaches for data pre-processing (e.g. resampling strategies)<br>\nPost-processing approaches<br>\nSampling approaches<br>\nFeature selection and feature transformation<br>\nEvaluation metrics and methodologies<br>\nEnsemble methods<br>\nInstance hardness</p>\n<p>*** Knowledge discovery and machine learning in imbalanced domains<br>\nClassification, ordinal classification<br>\nRegression<br>\nData streams and time series forecasting<br>\nClustering<br>\nAdaptive learning and algorithm-level approaches<br>\nMulti-label, multi-instance, sequence and association rules mining<br>\nActive learning<br>\nSpatial and spatio-temporal learning<br>\nText and image mining<br>\nMulti-modal learning<br>\nPredictive Maintenance<br>\nAutomated machine learning<br>\nEnergy-efficiency</p>\n<p>*** Applications in imbalanced domains<br>\nHealth applications (e.g. medical imaging)<br>\nFraud detection (e.g. finance, credit and online banking)<br>\nAnomaly detection (e.g. industry, intrusion detection, privacy and security)<br>\nEnvironmental applications (e.g. meteorology, biology, oil spill detection)<br>\nSocial media applications (e.g. popularity prediction, recommender systems)<br>\nFake news detection and disinformation, deep fake classification<br>\nOther real-world applications and case studies</p>\n<hr>\n<p>ORGANIZERS </p>\n<p>Nuno Moniz | INESC TEC / University of Porto, Portugal<br>\nPaula Branco | University of Ottawa, Canada<br>\nLuís Torgo | Dalhousie University, Canada<br>\nNathalie Japkowicz | American University, USA<br>\nMichał Woźniak | Wroclaw University of Science and Technology, Poland<br>\nShuo Wang | University of Birmingham, UK</p>",
