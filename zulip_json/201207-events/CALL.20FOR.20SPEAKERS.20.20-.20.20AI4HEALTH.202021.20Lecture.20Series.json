As in many other fields, the application of Machine Learning and the digitalisation is at the forefront, but topics such as Ethics, Healthcare and a system's reliability have also found their way into the debate on the topic of \"AI for humans\". In addition, many colleagues have successfully shown in the context of various applications that AI and Medicine can be brought together in a meaningful way. The aim of the lecture series, therefore, is to give practitioners, researchers, engineers and scientists a platform to present their work. <br>\n.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Organisation<br>\nThe time of the presentation can be freely chosen by each speaker. However, as last year, we plan to hold the presentations on Wednesday afternoon at 16.00 Luxembourg time. Due to Corona, it is planned that the lectures will take place virtually. There will be 50 minutes for the lecture plus 10 minutes for the discussion afterwards.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In case of interest, you may please contact me with your name and affiliation, the suggested title, a brief abstract, and the suggested date.
