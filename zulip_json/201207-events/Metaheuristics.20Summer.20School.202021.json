The main theme of this edition is “Learning and Optimization from Big Data”, therefore MESS 2020+1 wants to focus on (i) Learning for Metaheuristics; (ii) Optimization in Machine Learning; and (iii) how Optimization and Learning affect the Metaheuristics making them relevant in handling Big Data.</p>\n<p>Participants will be delivered a certificate of attendance indicating the number of hours of lectures (36-40 hours of lectures). In according to the academic system all PhD and master students attending to the summer school will may get 8 ECTS points. </p>\n<p>** LIST OF LECTURERS &amp; LECTURES TITLES</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Paolo Arena, Unviersity of Catania, Italy<br>\n     Lecture#1: TBA<br>\n     Lecture#2: TBA</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Angelo Cangelosi, University of Manchester &amp; Alan Turing Institute, UK<br>\n     Lecture#1: Cognitive and Developmental Robotics, part 1<br>\n     Lecture#2: Cognitive and Developmental Robotics, part 2</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Swagatam Das, Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata<br>\n     Lecture#1: Deep Generative Adversarial Networks and Their Application to Class-imbalanced Learning<br>\n     Lecture#2: Non-convex Constrained Optimization - Some Advanced Approaches</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Luca Maria Gambardella, IDSIA Istituto Dalle Molle for Artificial Intelligence, Switzerland<br>\n     Lecture#1: TBA<br>\n     Lecture#2:  TBA</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Salvatore Greco, University of Catania, Italy &amp; University of Portsmouth, UK<br>\n     Lecture#1: Preference Learning in Multicriteria Decision Support<br>\n     Lecture#2: Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization Guided by Preference Learning</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Giuseppe F.
