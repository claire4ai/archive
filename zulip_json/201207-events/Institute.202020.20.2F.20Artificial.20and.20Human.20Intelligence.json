The institute consists of an integrated school, panel, and doctoral colloquium  (primarily but not exclusively) aimed at early career doctoral researchers. Participants include professional academics / researchers, doctoral candidates and industry professionals, and research-driven students. The institute hosts an invited faculty delivering lectures, intensive tutorials, and keynotes; opportunities also exist for young researchers to position ongoing / early stage research, discuss, and network with institute faculty and participants.</p>\n<p>/  INSTITUTE FACULTY   /  </p>\n<p>—  Mehul Bhatt  (Örebro University, Sweden)   <br>\n—  Joanne Cleland  (University of Strathclyde, United Kingdom)<br>\n—  Paul Hemeren  (University of Skövde, Sweden)   <br>\n—  Árni Kristjánsson  (University of Iceland, Iceland)   <br>\n—  Daniel Levin  (Vanderbilt University, United States)   <br>\n—  Asli Özyürek  (Radbound University, Netherlands)   <br>\n—  Alessandra Russo (Imperial College London, United Kingdom)   <br>\n—  Barbara Tversky  (Stanford University, and Columbia University, United States)   <br>\n—  David Whitney  (UC Berkeley, United States)   </p>\n<p>—  [ Ongoing  /  Additional faculty members to be announced ]</p>\n<p>/  LEARNING FORMAT   /  </p>\n<p>The faculty will be involved in presenting mutually synergistic Keynotes, Lectures, and Tutorials. Furthermore, a Panel Discussion is also planned to discuss the theme of:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Human-Centred Confluence: Bottom-up Interdisciplinarity for the development of next generation human-centred AI technologies”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Course topics include:</p>\n<p>—  Artificial Intelligence and Spatial Cognition<br>\n—  Speech and Language. Visual Biofeedback.    <br>\n—  Psychophysics. Biological Motion.   <br>\n—  Visual Attention. Eye-Movements.<br>\n—  Visual Perception. Human Development.<br>\n—  Multimodal Linguistics.  Brain and Behaviour.<br>\n—  Artificial Intelligence. Knowledge Representation and Learning. <br>\n—  Declarative AI and Explainability / Combining Reasoning and Learning.<br>\n—  Motion. Spatial Cognition. Cognition.<br>\n—  Perception. Action. Vision. <br>\n—  Design Cognition and Computation.</p>\n<h2>CONFLUENCE  —  COGNITION.  AI.  INTERACTION.  DESIGN.</h2>\n<p>Research in Artificial and Human Intelligence aims to bring together and advance a novel &amp; unique combination of research methodologies, academics and communities encompassing artificial intelligence, cognitive science, neuroscience, psychology &amp; human development, human-computer interaction, and design science. In addition to pursuing its core scientific agenda, this line of inquiry also creates a discussion point for the development of interdisciplinary research, projects, collaborations, and other international people-exchange initiatives addressing the Confluence of Cognition, AI, Interaction, and Design.  </p>\n<p>/  HUMAN-CENTRED AI &amp; COGNITIVE TECHNOLOGIES  /</p>\n<p>The Institute addresses the formal &amp; cognitive foundations for human-centred computing (for AI), and the human-centred design, development, and usability of cognitive technologies aimed at human-in-the-loop assistance &amp; empowerment in decision-making, planning, creative-technical problem-solving, and automation. We emphasise development of novel foundational methods for human-centred AI keeping in mind: interpretability, generality or domain-independence, elaboration tolerance, benchmarking, and re-usability.</p>\n<p>/  MINDS.  EXPERIENCES.  TECHNOLOGIES  /  </p>\n<p>Of special interest is the design and development of artificial cognitive technologies where the human-centred modelling, interpretation, simulation, and synthesis of embodied cognitive experiences -e.g., encompassing multimodal perception and interaction- is critical.</p>\n<p>A details thematic focus is available at: <a href=\"http://www.codesign-lab.org/institute2020/focus.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.codesign-lab.org/institute2020/focus.html\">http://www.codesign-lab.org/institute2020/focus.html</a></p>\n<h2>INSTITUTE 2020 CHAIRS</h2>\n<p>—  Mehul Bhatt (Örebro University, Sweden)<br>\n  —  Paul Hemeren (University of Skövde, Sweden)<br>\n  —  Árni Kristjánsson (University of Iceland, Iceland)</p>\n<p>Institute details  &gt;  <a href=\"http://www.codesign-lab.org/institute2020/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.codesign-lab.org/institute2020/\">http://www.codesign-lab.org/institute2020/</a></p>\n<p>==================================================<br>\nApologies for cross-postings.<br>\n==================================================</p>",
