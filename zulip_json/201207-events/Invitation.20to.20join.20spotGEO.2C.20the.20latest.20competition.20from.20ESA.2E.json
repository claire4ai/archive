Can AI approaches cope with cloud cover, atmospheric/weather effects, light pollution, sensor noise/defects, star occlusions and more?</p>\n<p>Have a look at the <a href=\"https://kelvins.esa.int/spot-the-geo-satellites/\">Competition pages</a> and read also the <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Engineering_Technology/Telescope-peering_AI_challenged_to_spot_mystery_space_objects\">official ESA news</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Engineering_Technology/Telescope-peering_AI_challenged_to_spot_mystery_space_objects\" style=\"background-image: url(https://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2020/05/spotgeo_competition/22041759-1-eng-GB/spotGEO_competition_pillars.jpg)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Engineering_Technology/Telescope-peering_AI_challenged_to_spot_mystery_space_objects\" title=\"Telescope-peering AI challenged to spot mystery space objects\">Telescope-peering AI challenged to spot mystery space objects</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">ESA’s latest public competition challenges ‘citizen scientists’ to combine AI with observations from low-cost telescopes to pick out mystery objects in and around geostationary orbit, thousands of kilometres above Earth.</div></div></div>",
