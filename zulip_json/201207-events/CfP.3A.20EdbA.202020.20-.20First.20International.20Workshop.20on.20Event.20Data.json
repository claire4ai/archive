Apologies for cross-postings. </p>\n<hr>\n<p>Call for Papers</p>\n<p>EdbA 2020 - First International Workshop on Event Data and Behavioral Analytics</p>\n<p>5 October 2020<br>\nCo-located with the 2nd Int. Conference on Process Mining (ICPM)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.edba.science\">http://www.edba.science</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Due to the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been decided that ICPM 2020 will be a fully virtual conference. The same will apply to the EdbA workshop. Further details will follow as we get nearer to the workshop date.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The workshop aims to further the development of new (or the novel application of existing) techniques, algorithms and data structures for recording, storing, managing, processing, analyzing, and visualizing event data in various forms in order to gain insights in the behavior of various kinds. The workshop welcomes different types of submissions, i.e. original research papers, case study reports, position papers, idea papers, challenge papers and WiP papers on event data and behavioral analytics.</p>\n<p>Important Dates</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>Abstract submission deadline: August 18, 2020 (extended!)</li>\n<li>Papers submission deadline: August 25, 2020 (extended!)</li>\n<li>Notification: September 14, 2020</li>\n<li>Camera-ready deadline: September 22, 2020</li>\n<li>Workshop: October 5, 2020</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Scope</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Over the past decades, gathering, managing and analyzing event data has gained attention in various domains such as process mining, clickstream analytics, IoT analytics, e-commerce and retail analytics, online gaming analytics, security analytics, website traffic analytics and preventive maintenance to name a few. It even resulted in the birth of new research domains such as behavioral informatics, behavioral analytics and behavioral operations research. The interest in event data lies in its analytical potential as it captures the dynamic behavior of people, business entities, objects and/or systems at a fine-grained level.</p>\n<p>While each of these domains have their own applications and idiosyncrasies, they share the common denominator of event data and the objective to analyze behavior. Yet, these domains also differ in their underlying assumptions and techniques used. Therefore, the objective of this workshop is to provide a forum to practitioners and researchers for studying a quintessential, minimal notion of events as the common denominator for records of discrete behavior in all its forms, and to study, develop and discuss techniques and methods for behavioral analytics based on all kinds of events. </p>\n<p>The Event Data &amp; Behavioral Analytics (edba) workshop considers as its starting point how to gather event data being recorded at various sources and contexts, how to store event data in various forms, and how to exploit event data for analysis of behavior of various kinds. Event data at different levels of granularity are considered, ranging from frequent sensor-based events in IoT settings to recordings of aggregate or long-running behavior involving time intervals and rich information. Behavior often involves multiple entities, objects, and actors to which events can be correlated in various ways. In these situations, a unique explicit process notion does either not exist, is unclear or different processes or dynamics could be recorded in the same dataset. </p>\n<p>The workshop aims to further the development of new (or the novel application of existing) techniques, algorithms and data structures for recording, storing, managing, processing, analyzing, and visualizing event data in various forms. The workshop welcomes different types of submissions, i.e. original research papers, case study reports, position papers, idea papers, challenge papers and WiP papers on event data and behavioral analytics.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The topics considered in the workshop consist of, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Augmentation of fine-grained event data to higher order activities or behavior</li>\n<li>Gathering, storage, integration, and querying of behavioral event data</li>\n<li>Representation and analysis of event data without a unique case identifier (without case identifier or with multiple case identifiers present)</li>\n<li>Monitoring and detection of complex behavior</li>\n<li>Diagnosis of behavior, including root-cause analysis, variance analysis, cluster analysis and many other exploratory analysis techniques</li>\n<li>Visual analytics of (complex) behavior</li>\n<li>Behavior Pattern detection, e.g., in real-time location data or other types of context-rich data</li>\n<li>Outlier Behavior Detection</li>\n<li>Behavior Prediction</li>\n<li>Prescriptive analytics which predicts behavior and prescribes which action could steer behavior in a specific direction</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submissions</p>\n<hr>\n<p>We are interested in original research papers, case study reports, position papers, idea papers, challenge papers and WiP papers. Submissions must use the Springer LNCS/LNBIP ​format (see the instructions [1]) and cannot exceed 12 pages (always including tables, figures, the bibliography and appendices). Only papers in English will be considered and must present original research contributions not concurrently submitted elsewhere. Papers must be submitted electronically via the EasyChair portal [2].</p>\n<p>All accepted papers will appear in the workshop proceedings published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing (LNBIP) series. </p>\n<p>[1] <a href=\"https://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-791344-0\">https://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-791344-0</a><br>\n[2] <a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icpm2020\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icpm2020</a></p>\n<p>Program Committee</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>Jan Aerts, Hasselt University, Belgium</li>\n<li>Jochen De Weerdt, Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium</li>\n<li>Claudio di Ciccio, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy</li>\n<li>Bettina Fazinga, ICAR - National Research Council, Italy</li>\n<li>Marwan Hassani, Eindhoven University of Technology, the Netherlands</li>\n<li>Francesco Leotta, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy</li>\n<li>Xixi Lu, Utrecht University, the Netherlands</li>\n<li>Niels Martin, Hasselt University, Belgium</li>\n<li>Jan Mendling, Vienna University of Economics and Business, Austria</li>\n<li>Marco Montali, Free University of Bozen, Italy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Organisers</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>Benoît Depaire, Hasselt University, Belgium</li>\n<li>Fahland, Dirk, Eindhoven University of Technology, the Netherlands</li>\n<li>Mecella, Massimo, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy</li>\n<li>Senderovich, Arik, University of Toronto, Canada</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Contacts</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Web: <a href=\"http://www.edba.science/\">http://www.edba.science/</a><br>\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:benoit.depaire@uhasselt.be\">benoit.depaire@uhasselt.be</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-791344-0\" style=\"background-image: url(https://images.springer.com/cda/content/image/cda_displayimage.jpg?SGWID=0-0-16-2208184-0)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-791344-0\" title=\"Conference Proceedings guidelines | Springer\">Conference Proceedings guidelines | Springer</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Below you will find Springer's guidelines and technical instructions for the preparation of contributions to be published in one of the following seri</div></div></div>",
