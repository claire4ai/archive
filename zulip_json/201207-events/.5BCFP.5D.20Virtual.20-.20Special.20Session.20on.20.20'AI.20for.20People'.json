Hence, it can be defined as global citizens uniting to unlock the potential of individuals, technology and collaboration to create positive societal impact. It is about engagement, shareability and bringing people together to change the world for the better. At the same time, Artificial Intelligence (AI) research is mature enough for stable algorithms and approach to be used and play a crucial role in the aforementioned environments, enabling the deployment of revolutionary services and applications. It is envisioned that both the social interaction and the integration with smart devices will meaningfully impact societal development sustainability.</p>\n<p>This special session is dedicated to addressing major challenges in realizing intelligent platforms based on recent innovation in AI systems that can provide new ways of approaching problems and meaningfully improve people’s lives. We expect works that focus on the following areas: health, education, protecting democracy, urban planning, assistive technology for people with disabilities, smart and sustainable agriculture/fishing, environmental sustainability, search and rescue operations, emergency management, economic inequality, social welfare, justice, ethics, privacy, and security. The numerous emergent intelligent applications for social good may require an interdisciplinary approach, involving techniques from AI to communication networks, from IoT to data analysis, from social science to complex systems.</p>\n<p>Topics</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Authors are solicited to submit original, previously unpublished papers in the following, but not limited to, topic areas:</li>\n<li>Emerging trends of AI for social good</li>\n<li>Application of Deep, Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning techniques</li>\n<li>Continual Learning and Adaptation</li>\n<li>AI for smart cities</li>\n<li>Environmental quality monitoring</li>\n<li>Humans and goods transportation systems</li>\n<li>AI for emergency management</li>\n<li>Fog/Edge computing for the real-time execution of AI and data analytic</li>\n<li>Experimental results, simulators and benchmarks</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Features</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Best paper award</li>\n<li>Best-selected papers will be invited to submit an extended paper for publication in a dedicated Special Issue, 'AI for People', of AI&amp;Society: Knowledge, Culture and Communication (Springer) journal.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Publication</p>\n<p>All accepted and presented papers will be published in ACM International Conference Proceeding Series — ICPS and made available through ACM Digital Library.
