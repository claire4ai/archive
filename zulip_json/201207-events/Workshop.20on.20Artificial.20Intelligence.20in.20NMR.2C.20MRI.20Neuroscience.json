The format is both asynchronous (until March 31st) and synchronous (live session on Feb 19th, 2021).</p>\n<p><strong>The registration deadline is Feb 14th</strong> (extendable). The workshop also carries 30 ECM credits.</p>\n<p>In the hope that this initiative may be of interest for you and I would be most grateful if you could relay this scientific and educational resource among your local community as well as professional networks.</p>\n<p>Please, do not hesitate to contact me for more information.</p>\n<p>Best Regards,</p>\n<p>Nicola Toschi</p>\n<p>PS below you can find some social media posts of this annoucement for fast sharing:</p>\n<p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MedPhysTorVe/status/1351684619788296192\">https://twitter.com/MedPhysTorVe/status/1351684619788296192</a><br>\nFacebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/102581041868297/posts/102592848533783/?sfnsn=scwshmo\">https://www.facebook.com/102581041868297/posts/102592848533783/?sfnsn=scwshmo</a><br>\nInstagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CK7Z1Xlj416/?igshid=rtp5uwhaufph\">https://www.instagram.com/p/CK7Z1Xlj416/?igshid=rtp5uwhaufph</a><br>\nLinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nicola-toschi-5680923_physicists-computerscientist-engineers-activity-6757793367284969472-9IKh\">https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nicola-toschi-5680923_physicists-computerscientist-engineers-activity-6757793367284969472-9IKh</a></p>\n<p><strong>SHORT DESCRIPTION</strong>: The primary goal of this workshop is to bring together the diverse but overlapping communities of physicists, chemists, computer scientists, biologists, engineers, economists, clinicians and neuroscientists to explore novel, out-of-the box angles through which trans-disciplinary challenges in NMR, MRI and neuroscience research and technology can be tackled using Artificial Intelligence in a precision medicine context. This will include proposing a vision of the most promising directions and short/mid-term future scientific, technological, ethical and regulatory synergies. The mixed synchronous + aynchronous modality aims to maximize both attendance flexibility and interaction with the speakers as well as between attendees. <a href=\"/user_uploads/13862/TeXuZoAfo-7YClL6xsmZyyz0/AI_MRI_Neuroscience_workshop_synch_asynch.pdf\">AI_MRI_Neuroscience_workshop_synch_asynch.pdf</a><br>\n-- <br>\nProf. Nicola Toschi</p>\n<p>Associate Professor of Medical Physics<br>\nMedical Physics Section - Department of Biomedicine and Prevention<br>\nUniversity of Rome \"Tor Vergata\"<br>\nVia Montpellier 1 - 00133 Rome (IT)<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:toschi@med.uniroma2.it\">toschi@med.uniroma2.it</a></p>\n<p>Research Staff, Associate Investigator<br>\nA.A.
