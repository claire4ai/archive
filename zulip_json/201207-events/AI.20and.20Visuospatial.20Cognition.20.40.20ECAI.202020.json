With a focus on explainable visual sensemaking of dynamic visuospatial imagery, the tutorial demonstrates the integration of methods from AI and Vision with a focus on (combining) declarative reasoning \\&amp; learning about space, action, motion, and interaction. The tutorial is presented in the applied backdrop of areas as diverse as autonomous driving, cognitive robotics, design (for visual art, architecture, visuoauditory digital media), and behavioural visual perception research in cognitive psychology. The tutorial positions an emerging line of interdisciplinary research bringing together AI, Vision, Psychology, and Design.</p>\n<p>Sunday August 30, 13:45 to 17:00 (CET)<br>\nInfo   /   <a href=\"http://www.codesign-lab.org/cognitive-vision\">www.codesign-lab.org/cognitive-vision</a></p>\n<p>==================================<br>\nWORKSHOP @ ECAI 2020<br>\n==================================</p>\n<p>ARTIFICIAL AND HUMAN INTELLIGENCE<br>\n—  Formal and Cognitive Foundations for Human-Centred Computing</p>\n<p>Workshop Chair:  Mehul Bhatt (Örebro University, Sweden)<br>\nEuropean Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2020)</p>\n<p>Tuesday September 8, 12:00 to 18:30 (CET)<br>\nSchedule   /   <a href=\"http://www.codesign-lab.org/ecai2020/schedule.pdf\">www.codesign-lab.org/ecai2020/schedule.pdf</a><br>\nInfo   /   <a href=\"http://www.codesign-lab.org/ecai2020/\">www.codesign-lab.org/ecai2020/</a></p>\n<p>Joint Session  /  The workshop features a joint session with the workshop on \"Computational Argumentation and Cognition”  / <a href=\"http://cognition.ouc.ac.cy/cognitar/\">http://cognition.ouc.ac.cy/cognitar/</a></p>\n<p>Focus Group On: <br>\nMultimodal Rhetoric and Visuoauditory Media Studies: On the Role of Cognition and AI:  Select talks and a dedicated focus group / session in the workshop will address multimodality in the social media space, focussing on methodological issues related to computational cognitive vision, multimodal interaction, and visuospatial sensemaking as applicable in diverse contexts relevant to social sciences, (digital) humanities, and cognitive psychology. We particularly address the role that AI can serve in these contexts and reflect on recently commenced / ongoing interdisciplinary initiatives in the EU addressing these questions.</p>",
