That’s the big question on the table for our sixth joint “FLY AI” webinar on 15 June, 15:00-16:30 CET.</p>\n<p>AI and machine learning (ML) have a key role to play in mitigating cyber risk in aviation by identifying and responding to cybersecurity threats. However, AI can also be deployed for malicious intent, with hackers using the technology to commit larger-scale and more efficient attacks.</p>\n<p>For this webinar, we have lined up a panel of AI experts from different aviation organisations to help us build a clearer picture of how we can strengthen aviation’s cyber-resilience using AI, and to talk about the innovative AI/ML solutions that already exist to address cyber threats.</p>\n<p>More info and registration:  <a href=\"https://www.eurocontrol.int/event/ai-cyber-and-cyber-ai\">https://www.eurocontrol.int/event/ai-cyber-and-cyber-ai</a></p>",
