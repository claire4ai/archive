<p>The University of Mons (Belgium) announces the opening of a full-time tenure-track faculty position in artificial intelligence at the assistant professor level. The position is opened jointly in the Faculty of Science and the Faculty of Engineering, with a starting date of September 1, 2020. In a first stage, the person will be appointed for a period of three years, which can be extended with two extra years. The definitive appointment will be decided during or at the end of this period. The appointed person will take the lead of a new research group in the Department of Computer Science in the Faculty of Science.</p>
<p>Qualified candidates must have a doctorate in disciplines related to computer science or computer engineering, and should have an outstanding research record in the field of artificial intelligence, with a specialisation in machine learning. The selected person will develop research and teaching activities in this domain, will collaborate with existing research groups in the Faculty of Engineering and the Faculty of Science, and will be active in fundraising for industrial, governmental, and european projects.</p>
<p>The teaching duties include the following:</p>
<p>teaching activities in “Selected topic in artificial intelligence” (18 hours of lectures + 18 hours of practical work) in the Master in Computer Science and the Master in Computer Engineering and Management ;</p>
<p>teaching activities in “Advanced topics in artificial intelligence” (12 hours of lectures + 12 hours of practical work) in the Master in Computer Science and the Master in Computer Engineering and Management;</p>
<p>a participation in teaching activities in “Seminars of artificial intelligence” and “Challenges in artificial intelligence” in the Master in Computer Science, the Master in Computer Engineering and Management, and the Master in Electrical Engineering.</p>
<p>Some of these teaching activities can be followed by students in other disciplines. Additional teaching duties will be assigned at the levels of Bachelor and Master, in Computer Science, in Computer Engineering and Management, and in Electrical Engineering, so that the appointed person will eventually have the same teaching load as other faculty members in the Faculty of Engineering and the Faculty of Science. The appointed person will supervise projects, master theses, and doctoral theses in both faculties. The appointed person will also be active in teaching activities at the campus of the University of Mons in the city of Charleroi. The appointed person should be capable to teach in French and in English. An appointed person who is not francophone, should be capable of teaching in the French language within a period of at most two years, starting at September 1, 2020.</p>
