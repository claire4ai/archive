<p>The Reasoning and Learning Group at Linköping University in Sweden has two open postdoc positions (up to 2 years each) for doing curiosity driven basic research in the intersection between reasoning and learning. Application deadline August 24.</p>
<p>We are a growing research group with a broad interest in AI. We are especially interested in spatio-temporal reasoning and learning such as learning and reasoning about trajectories and events/activities, incremental reasoning and learning such as a stream reasoning and learning, multi-agent reasoning and learning such as combinatorial assignment and multi-agent reinforcement learning, and reasoning and learning for Trustworthy AI such as privacy-preserving synthetic data generation and run-time verification for safe autonomous systems.</p>
<p>At least one of the postdocs will work on developing new machine learning methods for creating privacy preserving synthetic spatio-temporal trajectory data sets. The goal is to 1) extend generative adversarial network (GAN) methods to learn generative spatio-temporal trajectory models and 2) develop new Bayesian Optimization methods for creating tailored privacy-preserving synthetic data sets using these generative models.</p>
<p>For more information and to apply see:<br>

<p>The application deadline is August 24, but if there are interesting candidates that will finish during the fall, I am open to either extending the application period or re-open the positions later. It would be good if they could start at the latest early next year. It is possible to start working remotely if needed.</p>
<p>If you want to know more please get in touch!</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
