<p>Open Position:   Research Scientist –  AI and Ethics.    </p>
<p>The Frankfurt Big Data Lab is looking for an outstanding and motivated researcher to join the strong network of researchers working on the definition of an assessment process for Ethical AI, called Z-inspection.<br>
Z-inspection is being currently developed by the team of Prof. Zicari at the Frankfurt Big Data Lab and it could be part of an   Ethics by Design process, or if the AI has already been designed, it can be used to do an   ethical sanity check, so that a certain AI Ethical standard of care is achieved. It can be used by a variety of AI stakeholders.</p>
<p>Z-inspection is an open development and incremental improvement to establish our process and brand (“Z Inspected”). The project is interdisciplinary in its nature.</p>
