<p><strong>Open Position: Researcher for Software Engineering in Speech Processing, at Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW)</strong></p>
<p>We have a major research project on dialogue systems, starting in Autumn 2020, where we need a software engineer who collaborates with our speech processing experts. Goal of the project is a system that will "simulate" a kid in a police interview (i.e. an animated avatar plus speech recognition). Each simulated kid has a story that is based on true cases, and a personality that prompts its behaviour. Our system will be a key means in the education of the police officers, such that they can become better suited for real-life interviews with children.</p>
