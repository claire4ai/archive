<p>15 PhD positions are offered within NoBIAS- Artificial Intelligence without Bias, a project funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant Agreement No. 860630.</p>
<p>NoBIAS aims at developing novel methods for AI-based decision making without bias by taking into account ethical and legal considerations in the design of technical solutions. The core objectives of NoBIAS are to understand legal, social and technical challenges of bias in AI-decision making, to counter them by developing fairness-aware algorithms to automatically explain AI results, and to document the overall process for data provenance and transparency.</p>
